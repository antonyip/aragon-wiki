We want to empower people across the world to easily and securely manage their organizations. We provide the tools for anyone to become an entrepreneur and run their own organization, to take control of their own lives.\n\n\nBy making it possible for everyone in the world to organize, we are enabling a borderless, permissionless and more efficient creation of value.\n\n\nGOODBYE UNNECESSARY INTERMEDIARIES\n\n\n\nReclaim your independence\n\n\n\n\nAragon organizations are powered by Ethereum, a global blockchain for running unstoppable applications. In Ethereum, code and applications always run without any possibility of downtime or censorship.\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology provides a single shared source of cryptographically verified truth. This is secured by a network made up of thousands of computers all over the globe. Anyone can set up their own node where all the necessary data is replicated across the network.\n\n\nThis decentralized design ensures a borderless and permissionless way of operating, without the fear of a government or a malicious third-party interfering.\n\n\nIMAGINE A NATION WITHOUT LAND AND BORDERS\n\n\n\nA digital jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network will be the first community governed decentralized organization whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction, an online decentralized court system that isn\u2019t bound by traditional artificial barriers such as national jurisdictions or the borders of a single country.\n\n\n\n\nAragon organizations can be upgraded seamlessly using our aragonOS architecture. They can solve disputes between two parties by using the decentralized court system, a digital jurisdiction that operates only online and utilizes your peers to resolve issues.\n\n\nThe Aragon Network Token, ANT, puts the power into the hands of the people participating in the operation of the Network. Every single aspect of the Network will be governed by those willing to make an effort for a better future.\n\n\nAragon client\n\n\nDecentralized application to run your organization\n\n\n\nTRANSFER TOKENS\n\n\n\nTokens represent your stake in the organization\n\n\nYour organization is in control of its funds. Transfer and assign them according to your personal needs without artificial limitations.\n\n\nFUNDRAISING\n\n\n\nGrasp the potential of a new form of crowdfunding\n\n\nUtilize the power of the crowd for funding and raise funds globally, in private or publicly, without relying on banks or financial gatekeepers.\n\n\nVOTING\n\n\n\nDecision-making by voting\n\n\nUse voting for more effective results. Votes are a secure, transparent and unforgeable way to come to a decision on major issues.\n\n\nPAYMENTS\n\n\n\nInstant payments in a few clicks\n\n\nAdding a new employee to your organization and payroll is as easy as creating a new recurring payment.\n\n\nACCOUNTING\n\n\n\nTamper-proof, effective accounting\n\n\n\n\nEvery transaction is recorded and can be verified on the blockchain at any given time\n\n\n\n\nUnprecedented level of transparency can be gained through the use of a public blockchain to engrave every entry permanently on the ledger.\n\n\nPre-established rules can automatically define your quarterly spending and budgeting.\n\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\n\n\nFlexible and resilient privilege escalation\n\n\n\n\nFine-grained permissions deliver the freedom to create an organization that will work for you.\n\n\n\n\nPermissions can be granular and assigned in fine detail. You can choose to give people a certain degree of control over the organization and privileges can be escalated easily through a voting or different mechanisms if the person isn't allowed to directly perform a desired action.\n\n\nBy assigning different permissions to people, you can create the kind of organizational structure that is best suited for your needs.\n\n\nAragon Network\n\n\nEnsuring the success of decentralized organizations\n\n\n\nPutting the power back into the hands of the users\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network will decentralize its governance by gradually handing over control of the project to its users.\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network will establish additional services for the organizations taking advantage of what Aragon provides.\n\n\nOur mission is to make the Aragon Network an autonomous organization itself, which is managed by the people using it for their mutual prosperity.\n\n\nARAGON GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS\n\n\n\nJoin us in improving Aragon by making your voice heard\n\n\nAragon Governance Proposals\n is a system for community members to join the discussion and create proposals affecting Aragon.\n\n\nEveryone is welcome to \njoin in and aid\n in forging the future of how Aragon will shape out to be. Together we can build the exciting future we want to see.\n\n\nWhy Aragon?\n\n\n\n\nAragon was born to bring transparency and independent governance to the forefront of managing an organization. We want to give the users the freedom they deserve to run their lives.\n\n\n\n\nOrganizations like companies exist to create value for their owners and users. They use the resources available to them in order to provide services and to create products.\n\n\nTheir ability to do this efficiently is hindered by factors outside of their influence. By removing unnecessary intermediaries and third parties that impose artificial restrictions and unnecessarily complex regulations, we can modernize the way organizations are run.\n\n\nOUR VISION\n\n\n\nEvolution of the internet and blockchain technology are changing the ways we interact with each other\n\n\nWe believe that the progression of modern technology solutions, such as the invention of the blockchain, are changing the incentives for people to interact with each other. We are building the tools for the next generation of organizations to take advantage of this revolution.\n\n\nExperimenting with new governance models has been a very risky endeavour during previous iterations of society. Now, for the first time in human history, we can let a thousand new governance models emerge, all from the comfort of our laptops.\n\n\nCommunication channels\n\n\nAragon Mailing List - \nhttps://one.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a590aa3843a54b079d48e6e18&id=e81a44c4bd\n\n\nAragon Chat - \nhttps://aragon.chat\n\n\nAragon Forum - \nhttps://forum.aragon.org\n\n\nReddit - \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/aragonproject/\n\n\nTwitter - \nhttps://twitter.com/aragonproject\n\n\nLinkedIn - \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/aragonproject/\n\n\nYouTube - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/AragonProject\n\n\nTeams\n\n\n\n\nTo encourage other teams to work on Aragon, we will be splitting off the Association to form a company of core developers.

Our fear is that without a global, conscious, and concerted effort, the outlook is incredibly bleak.\n\n\nThe Internet has opened the doors for universal, cross-border, and non-violent collaborative effort to \nfight for our freedom\n.\n\n\nHowever, the Internet has also opened the doors for global surveillance and manipulation.\n\n\nWe believe humankind \nshould use technology as a liberating tool\n to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another.\n\n\nThus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies.\n\n\nDecentralized technologies provide users unparalleled power\n to transact and interact with a level of security never seen before. Thanks to cryptography and economic incentives, users can now own truly sovereign assets, create fully sovereign entities, and build truly sovereign identities. They solidify freedoms that cannot be taken away, not even by actors with sizeable resources. This tectonic shift requires a new method for organizing these sovereign individuals: \ndecentralized organizations.\n\n\nFor the first time in history, thanks to blockchain technology and smart contracts, we can now create fully decentralized organizations, which are truly autonomous and unstoppable.\n\n\nDecentralized organizations change our relationship with \ngovernance\n: from something that is imposed upon us by others, into something we choose to opt into.

            "text": "We will either see technology lead to a more free, open, and fair society or reinforce a global regime of centralized control, surveillance, and oppression. Our fear is that without a global, conscious, and concerted effort, the outlook is incredibly bleak.  The Internet has opened the doors for universal, cross-border, and non-violent collaborative effort to  fight for our freedom .  However, the Internet has also opened the doors for global surveillance and manipulation.  We believe humankind  should use technology as a liberating tool  to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another.  Thus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies.  Decentralized technologies provide users unparalleled power  to transact and interact with a level of security never seen before. Thanks to cryptography and economic incentives, users can now own truly sovereign assets, create fully sovereign entities, and build truly sovereign identities. They solidify freedoms that cannot be taken away, not even by actors with sizeable resources. This tectonic shift requires a new method for organizing these sovereign individuals:  decentralized organizations.  For the first time in history, thanks to blockchain technology and smart contracts, we can now create fully decentralized organizations, which are truly autonomous and unstoppable.  Decentralized organizations change our relationship with  governance : from something that is imposed upon us by others, into something we choose to opt into. Where we are equally serving and served, rather than just serving.  Building tools to create and manage decentralized organizations will unleash a  Cambrian explosion  of new governance forms, and the competition among them will raise the bar globally.  It will finally allow us to experiment with governance at the speed of software.  Instead of complaining about how badly incentives are set in the world and how poorly resources are allocated, we will have the power to create systems that better align incentives and distribute resources. This is the Enlightenment of the century.  Sovereign individuals will be able to freely express themselves and transact with each other  without any kind of intermediary  exercising their unjustified power and oppressing them.

If the person who is harassing you is one of these admins, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as possible.\n\n\nThis code of conduct applies to Aragon community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Aragon community or team member outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Aragon community or team members seriously. This includes harassment outside of our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time.

We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.\n\n\nScope\n\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within the Aragon project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include presenting themselves as Aragon community members, promoting the Aragon project as well as using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by the Aragon team.\n\n\nEnforcement\n\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Aragon projects team at \nAragon Chat\n. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The Aragon team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\n\nAragon community members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the Aragon team.\n\n\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\n\n\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Aragon response team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Aragon project spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Aragon community members or the general public. Admins/moderators must recuse themselves from moderation decisions regarding a community member they may have a conflict of interest with, delegating moderation decisions to an un-involved moderator or Aragon Association executive.\n\n\nAragon.Chat\n\n\nAragon project's chat channels descriptions tell you what is considered proper on-topic discussion on that channel, we want everyone to abide by these discussion topics, but using common sense is allowed. We won't remove you from the channel unless there is sustained disruption of discussion. All communication in the channels is to be in English, unless stated otherwise.\n\n\nKeep your messages \nDRY\n, don't repeat yourself, choose a proper channel to post your message, link or other communication and only post that on one channel.

            "text": "Software Licences\n\n\nAragon's licenses\n\n\nWhen deciding about what are the best open source licenses to release components of the Aragon Project, one of the main characteristics that those licenses need to have is the empowerment and freedom to those who seek to improve the software and contribute it back to the community. Actions from for-profit entities that benefit from open source without giving back should be disincentivized. The other main characteristic is the respect of user\u2019s freedom: \u201cFreedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve a program\u201d. Users, individually and collectively, should control the software and not the other way around. This is the main and broad reasoning behind our choices.\n\n\nMore specifically, when a tool offers unique capabilities and functionality we want the future generations of those tools to remain free (libre).

Actions from for-profit entities that benefit from open source without giving back should be disincentivized. The other main characteristic is the respect of user\u2019s freedom: \u201cFreedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve a program\u201d. Users, individually and collectively, should control the software and not the other way around. This is the main and broad reasoning behind our choices.  More specifically, when a tool offers unique capabilities and functionality we want the future generations of those tools to remain free (libre).

            "text": "Aragon 0.5 Audit by Adam Dossa\n\n\nThis was the initial review of the aragonOS system that powers the v0.5 release of Aragon. Further audits and public bug\nbounty programs are scheduled to begin in early January 2018.\n\n\nAll the changes triggered as result of the audit can be found in the \naragonOS\n and \naragon-apps\n repos\n\n\nThe original PDF report has been converted to Markdown for easier reading. You can download unmodified report from the auditor here:\n\n\nDownload original PDF\n\n\nThe repository \naragon-core\n has been renamed to \naragonOS\n after this audit took place and that change has been reflected in this document. See the PDF file above for the untouched original report.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis audit report was undertaken by \n@adamdossa\n for the purpose of providing feedback to Aragon.\n\nIt has been written without any express or implied warranty.\n\n\nThe review focussed on the Solidity contract code in these repos, and covered:\n\n\n\n\npossible attack vectors\n\n\nmismatches between logic and documentation\n\n\npossible code improvements\n\n\nconfusing functionality or naming\n\n\n\n\nThe review was performed using the code tagged with \naudit1\n at the following commits.\n\n\naragonOS\n:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/audit1/contracts\n\n\naragon-apps\n:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/audit1/apps\n\n\nWe used RocketChat to coordinate the review and help resolve questions during the review process.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOverall the code structure was readable, well-documented and structured coherently and consistently.\n\n\nFunctions largely conform to the best practices at:\n\n\nhttps://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/style-guide.html\n\nmaking the structure and code easy to parse and understand.\n\n\nThe codebase also included comprehensive testing suites, using the Truffle testing framework. The Aragon team also employs a coverage framework and linter process to ensure their code remains consistent and testing comprehensive.\n\n\nThe team was responsive, measured and prompt in their responses and feedback during the process.\n\n\nGeneral Comments\n\n\n\n\nThere were a few functions that were missing explicit function visibility modifiers. This has been\nreviewed and corrected (including linter updates) via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/pull/33\n\n\nIn addition to the below there are a few miscellaneous fixes and improvements that have been made, including additional testing coverage and minor fixes. These include:\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/49253097831a6f979c68c309ae0c6c00c325af4d\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/c239847065eebb2f2b3ea2dbc264b8a25cd788cd\n\nas well as many other incremental improvements which have been made during and after this audit process.\n\n\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/kernel\n\n\nThese contracts form the core Kernel implementation. The Kernel manages app and Kernel permissions and provides a layer of indirection to access apps (allowing apps, including the Kernel, to be upgraded as necessary).\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nThere were a few areas of the documentation which were either out-dated, or possibly confusing.\n\nThese included:\n\n\n\n\ndescription of \nGrant Permission\n which has now been amended to make the conditions of this operation clearer.\n\n\nmaking the separation between instantiation and initialisation clearer.\n\n\ncorrecting some minor mistakes in the example code for \nCreate Permission\n\n\n\n\nThese issues have now been resolved in a number of pull requests:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/32b6f1cfb396c8974a2be4e925111e33dbe9b275\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/b2cde71d3faa8212a3124813901b8d5280d93c76\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/c3a734c651a04052cea0dc80753079a4a6a9ab82\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\nSome possible future improvements were identified, specifically:\n\n\n\n\nevents being triggered when permissions were used.\n\n\nmanaging the instantiation / initialisation of contracts (see below section for more details).\n\n\ncontinuing to work on documentation to make the permission framework as clear as possible.\n\n\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/apps \nand\n aragonOS/contracts/common\n\n\nThese contracts contains the logic required for both proxy contracts (which allow the underlying \"business logic\" contracts to be upgraded) and forwarding (which allows entities to forward transaction scripts to other entities for execution).\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\nPre-Byzantium logic could now be removed from \nDelegateProxy\n as \nreturndatasize\n opcodes are now available. This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/145\n  \n\n\nThe use of \ndelegatecall\n to execute underlying App logic is a clever way of preserving state and Ether value in the \nDelegateProxy\n whilst using the code / business logic of an upgradable \nApp\n contract. The below represent areas that could be clarified in the documentation, rather than bugs in the code.\n\n\nSince the \nApp\n code is expected to have state / storage, this imposes a limitation that any new upgraded version of the \nApp\n has a superset of the previous contract which it is replacing.\n\n\nSince state is maintained in the \nDelegateProxy\n contract, not the underlying \nApp\n contract, this may cause some practical issues with third-party apps such as exchanges or etherscan.io (for example I don't believe the \"Read Contract\" functionality on etherscan.io would work as the ABI wouldn't have the relevant functions on the \nDelegateProxy\n contract, and the state on the \nApp\n contract wouldn't reflect updates).\n\n\nThere were a few areas of documentation which use inconsistent terminology (e.g. scaling vs. forwarding) which have been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/c3a734c651a04052cea0dc80753079a4a6a9ab82\n\n\nOne of the identified issues related to the instantiation and initialisation of \nAppProxy\n contracts not being atomic. In the expected use-cases, where \nAppProxy\n contracts are instantiated and initialised through a factory process (within a single atomic transaction) this is not problematic, but there is\nsome potential for this structure to be abused in unexpected use-cases, allowing a malicious user to front-run \nAppProxy\n contracts. The Aragon team discussed various options internally and an approach was implemented to allow an optional \ninitializePayload\n to be passed to the \nAppProxy\n constructor, which can be used to initialise the contract as part of its instantiation.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/148\n\n\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nGiven the use of \ndelegatecall\n, the documentation could clarify the intention as to whether \nApp\n contracts are designed to be used as factory contracts, or redeployed for each Aragon organisation.\n\n\nIt may be sensible to make the \n10000\n gas in \nAppProxy\n a variable that can be modified to account for any future changes to opcode gas costs for \ndelegatecall\n.\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/voting/contracts\n\n\nThis contract allows votes to take place on arbitrary actions, using the MiniMeToken to determine voting power of token holders.\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\nThe \nVoterState\n of \nAbsent\n doesn't seem to be used anywhere - not sure if this is in for some future purpose perhaps, if not it could be removed.\n\n\nThe \nVoting\n app automatically executed a vote payload once the outcome of the vote was beyond doubt. Whilst this is useful functionality, it made it hard for a voter to estimate gas requirements and the effect of their vote transaction deterministically (as the outcome depended on whether or not the vote tipped the balance). A boolean parameter has now been introduced to allow a voter to specify whether or not they want their vote to automatically execute the vote payload (if appropriate) via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/ae8a92e05c9bb90892da24e09ba1354fe49514ac\n\n\n\n\nPossible improvements\n\n\n\n\nCurrently the duration of a vote is fixed on initialisation of the \nVoting\n contract - it may be worth considering making this a per-Vote variable instead to allow for both long and short-dated votes. Since the \n_minAcceptQuorumPct\n can be modified during the lifetime of the contract, it may be that users also want to change \nvoteTime\n as well.\n\n\nThe event \nCastVote\n should include the number of votes being cast to allow easier off-chain tracking of vote status. This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/8ea8cda2d190a695d2a7ec0d7680c4c8bafd5054\n\n\nWhen modifying the \n_minAcceptQuorumPct\n through \nchangeMinAcceptQuorumPct\n it may be worth emitting an event for this change. This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/03f26441f60a4dedd042749972218fb6dadaa9de\n\n\nWhen creating a new vote through the \nforward\n method, it may be worth putting a non-blank \n_metadata\n in to make it clearer to track where the vote has come from. This could incorporate the forwarding entities address.\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/token-manager/contracts\n\n\nThis contract manages token actions through the MiniMeToken contract (either wrapping another token, or natively).\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\ncanForward\n allows holders of tokens which have not yet vested to forward request - this may be intentional, but worth clarifying in the documentation.\n\n\nIt is technically possible for a single \nTokenManager\n to be set as the controller for multiple \nMiniMeToken\n contracts. It may be worth asserting in the \nTokenController\n functions (\nonApprove\n, \nonTransfer\n, \nproxyPayment\n) that \nmsg.sender\n matches the expected \ntoken\n value, to avoid any\nmisconfiguration.\n\n\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nThe vesting model follows broadly the Zeppelin approach. In my experience clients have often wanted a simpler model with a single cliff date, upon which all tokens vest. This is not possible to achieve with the implemented approach as the tokens must vest linearly between the start and vesting dates (with nothing vesting before the cliff date).\n\n\nIt may be worth mentioning in the documentation that it is important to set the \ncontroller\n in the \nMiniMeToken\n to be the \nTokenManager\n (i.e. that it isn't sufficient to initialise the \nTokenManager\n with the \nMiniMeToken\n but that the link needs to go both ways).\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/group/contracts\n\n\nThis contract acts as a simple way to permission a group of entities as a single entity.\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\nIn the documentation, there is a minor grammatical mistake - the phrase \"This is needed for identification purposes, given that the only other context the group possesses.\" should perhaps be \"This is needed for identification purposes, given that it is the only context the group possesses.\".\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/fundraising/contracts\n\n\nThis contract is responsible for raising funds (in any ERC20 token, which could include wrapped Ether) in return for a new ERC20 token.\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\nIn line 297, it should be \n(period.finalPrice != initialPrice)\n rather than \n(period.finalPrice != 0)\n. From the documentation, it says:\n\n\"A period has an initial and final price. If they are not the same, price for a given timestamp is linearly interpolated in function of time.\" This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/49253097831a6f979c68c309ae0c6c00c325af4d\n\n\nIn function \n_buy\n the calculation of \nreturnAmount\n is subject to rounding errors I believe. i.e. in the \nisInversePrice\n case, if dividing by \npricePrecision\n leads to rounding, then re-multiplying by \npricePrecision\n may not yield the expected value. This is an issue that is worth being aware of, but is unlikely to lead to any genuine problems.\n\n\nThe \ninitialize\n function could check that the \nTokenManager\n is running in native (rather than wrapped) mode by checking the public variable \n_tokenManager.wrappedToken == 0\n.\n\n\nHaving \ngetCurrentPrice\n behave differently on a \ncall\n / \nsendTransaction\n may be confusing. You could refactor this so that it is genuinely a \nconstant\n function instead. I agree that functionally this works as \ntransitionSalePeriodIfNeeded\n is always called before any other state modifying functions execute.\n\n\ncalculatePrice\n has an implicit dependency on \ntransitionSalePeriodIfNeeded\n being called before it is used. This could be enforced in the function (e.g. by checking that the current timestamp is between \nsale.periodStartTime\n and \nsale[currentPeriod].periodEnds\n. This is redundant in the current code (since \ntransitionSalePeriodIfNeeded\n is always called before \ncalculatePrice\n but would make it harder to make errors in the future, or in derived contracts). This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/c239847065eebb2f2b3ea2dbc264b8a25cd788cd\n\n\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nAdding a token purchase function which allows a beneficiary address (rather than \nmsg.sender\n) to receive tokens may be useful.\n\n\nHaving the ability to associate a script to be called on a sale closing may be useful. This script could for example ensure that no more tokens could be minted (effectively capping the issued tokens supply) by revoking \nMINT_ROLE\n permissions from the \nTokenManager\n, or allow the \nFundRaising\n contract to transfer \nCREATE_SALES_ROLE\n permission to a different entity (i.e. a\n\nVotingApp\n associated with the token being issued).\n\n\nMaybe worth making the distinction between tokens being raised, and tokens being issued clearer through consistent variable naming. Tracking which variables correspond to \nraisedToken\n and which correspond to tokens being issued was confusing (maybe consistently call this \nraisedToken\n and \nissuedToken\n or similar). i.e. \nuint256 returnTokens = ...\n could become \nuint256 returnRaisedTokens = ...\n, \n_payedTokens\n could become \n_paidRaisedTokens\n, \n_value\n in \ntokenFallback\n could become \n_paidRaisedToken\n, \nsale.minBuy\n would become \nsale.minRaised\n and so on.\n\n\nI'm not sure what the motivation to have multiple (potentially concurrent) ongoing sales is? I guess if you wanted to raise from a mix of tokens that would make sense (as each \nSale\n could have a different \nraisedToken\n), but in this case you wouldn't have a consolidated cap etc., which would make it confusing. I can see that it may be required to have a follow-on sale, but wonder whether having each sale being represented by a new FundRaisingProxy may be simpler / clearer.\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/finance/contracts\n\n\nThis contract is responsible for tracking transactions (payments or deposits) across an organisations token balances, and managing scheduled payments.\n\n\nGiven the importance of this contract and the value there would be in exploiting it, it may be worth having this specific contract be audited separately by multiple individuals and / or placing a bounty within a live deployment to encourage investigation.\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\nAny reason why the minimum payment duration is 2, rather than 1:\n\n\nrequire(_periodDuration > 1);\n\nI can see that you use \nsettings.periodDuration - 1\n as the duration length, but not clear why you don't just use \nsettings.periodDuration\n (with the requirement that \nsettings.periodDuration > 0\n);\n\n\nIn both \ntokenFallback\n, and \ndeposit\n the \n_token.transferFrom\n and \ntoken.transfer\n methods could potentially re-enter the \nFinance\n app. I can't immediately see how this can cause an issue, but worth being aware of.\n\n\nIt may be worth mentioning in the documentation that payments can be \"back-dated\", in which case the receiver will be eligible to execute all \"back-dated\" payments. This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/b2cde71d3faa8212a3124813901b8d5280d93c76\n\n\nIf the budget for a token is reduced during a period (via \nsetBudget\n) it is possible that \n_getRemainingBudget\n may throw if the amount already spent (\n\nperiods[currentPeriodId()].tokenStatement[_token].expenses\n) is larger than the new budget (in which case \nsettings.budgets[_token].sub(spent)\n will throw). It may be better to return 0 rather than throwing in this case.\n\n\n_makePaymentTransaction\n could record the payment reference in the corresponding transaction reference.\n\n\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nThere are no restrictions on what ERC20 tokens can be used for deposits.

This has now been resolved via:  https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/145     The use of  delegatecall  to execute underlying App logic is a clever way of preserving state and Ether value in the  DelegateProxy  whilst using the code / business logic of an upgradable  App  contract. The below represent areas that could be clarified in the documentation, rather than bugs in the code.  Since the  App  code is expected to have state / storage, this imposes a limitation that any new upgraded version of the  App  has a superset of the previous contract which it is replacing.  Since state is maintained in the  DelegateProxy  contract, not the underlying  App  contract, this may cause some practical issues with third-party apps such as exchanges or etherscan.io (for example I don't believe the \"Read Contract\" functionality on etherscan.io would work as the ABI wouldn't have the relevant functions on the  DelegateProxy  contract, and the state on the  App  contract wouldn't reflect updates).  There were a few areas of documentation which use inconsistent terminology (e.g. scaling vs. forwarding) which have been resolved via:  https://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/c3a734c651a04052cea0dc80753079a4a6a9ab82  One of the identified issues related to the instantiation and initialisation of  AppProxy  contracts not being atomic. In the expected use-cases, where  AppProxy  contracts are instantiated and initialised through a factory process (within a single atomic transaction) this is not problematic, but there is\nsome potential for this structure to be abused in unexpected use-cases, allowing a malicious user to front-run  AppProxy  contracts. The Aragon team discussed various options internally and an approach was implemented to allow an optional  initializePayload  to be passed to the  AppProxy  constructor, which can be used to initialise the contract as part of its instantiation.  https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/148",

This is an issue that is worth being aware of, but is unlikely to lead to any genuine problems.  The  initialize  function could check that the  TokenManager  is running in native (rather than wrapped) mode by checking the public variable  _tokenManager.wrappedToken == 0 .  Having  getCurrentPrice  behave differently on a  call  /  sendTransaction  may be confusing. You could refactor this so that it is genuinely a  constant  function instead. I agree that functionally this works as  transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded  is always called before any other state modifying functions execute.  calculatePrice  has an implicit dependency on  transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded  being called before it is used. This could be enforced in the function (e.g. by checking that the current timestamp is between  sale.periodStartTime  and  sale[currentPeriod].periodEnds . This is redundant in the current code (since  transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded  is always called before  calculatePrice  but would make it harder to make errors in the future, or in derived contracts).

Maybe worth making the distinction between tokens being raised, and tokens being issued clearer through consistent variable naming. Tracking which variables correspond to  raisedToken  and which correspond to tokens being issued was confusing (maybe consistently call this  raisedToken  and  issuedToken  or similar). i.e.  uint256 returnTokens = ...  could become  uint256 returnRaisedTokens = ... ,  _payedTokens  could become  _paidRaisedTokens ,  _value  in  tokenFallback  could become  _paidRaisedToken ,  sale.minBuy  would become  sale.minRaised  and so on.  I'm not sure what the motivation to have multiple (potentially concurrent) ongoing sales is? I guess if you wanted to raise from a mix of tokens that would make sense (as each  Sale  could have a different  raisedToken ), but in this case you wouldn't have a consolidated cap etc., which would make it confusing. I can see that it may be required to have a follow-on sale, but wonder whether having each sale being represented by a new FundRaisingProxy may be simpler / clearer.",

I don't see any good way around this, as this is a pretty general problem plaguing all systems implementing revocable controls. It may be a good idea to note this in the comments and associated documentation.

However, given the current implementation, it would require multiple steps to change the \nminAcceptQuorumPct\n for a single vote (you'd have to change it, create a vote, and then change it back).\n\n\nImplementing this could be done via an overload, storing the quorum percentage given on initialization as the default percentage. \nforward()\n should always use the default percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \nstruct Vote\n, \nstartDate\n and \nexecuted\n could be grouped together to save some storage\n\n\nstruct Vote\n's \ntotalVoters\n could be renamed to \ntotalPossible\n to avoid confusion over whether it holds the total number of individual voters or total possible votes\n\n\ncanExecute()\n should use \n.add()\n (l153): \nuint256 totalVotes = vote.yea.add(vote.nay)\n\n\nview\n getters can be made \nexternal\n\n\n_isVoteOpen()\n should cast up rather than down: \nreturn now < uint256(vote.startDate).add(uint256(voteTime)) && !vote.executed;\n\n\n_isValuePct()\n could be renamed to \n_isAtLeastPct()\n for clarity\n\n\n_isValuePct()\n should use \n.mul()\n (l268): \nuint256 m = _total.mul(_pct)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\n\n\nSolgraph\n\n\n\n\nOnly \nEtherToken.sol\n was flagged for having an untrusted \ntransfer()\n to another contract (see \nOyente\n for a note on this).\n\n\nNoted that solgraph is non-exhaustive and only assumes contracts to be untrusted if they send funds to an external contract. However, it can be useful for quickly telling which contracts are likely to be more complicated, as well as helping visualize the interdependencies between functions in a contract.\n\n\n\n\nTest details\n\n\nCreated function graphs via:\n\n\n# Globstar and multiple variable substitutions may have to be turned on in your shell\n\n# aragonOS\nfor contract in contracts/**/*.sol; do\n    echo 'Graphing' ${contract}\n    mkdir -p solgraph/${${contract#contracts/}%/*}\n    solgraph ${contract} | dot -Tpng > solgraph/${${contract#contracts/}%\\.sol}.png\ndone\n\n# aragon-apps\nmkdir -p solgraph/aragon-apps\n\nfor contract in aragon-apps/apps/**/contracts/*.sol; do\n    echo 'Graphing' ${contract}\n    solgraph ${contract} | dot -Tpng > solgraph/aragon-apps/${${contract#*/contracts/}%\\.sol}.png\ndone\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: currently requires \nmy fork of \nsolgraph\n (install via \nnpm install -g git+https://github.com/sohkai/solgraph.git\n)\n\n\nOyente\n\n\n\n\nIn non-lib files, Oyente only reported a single potential error: \nEtherToken.sol\n (transaction order dependency)\n\n\nOn analysis, this does not seem to be a real problem.

Initializable  library instances can be initialized:  aragonOS/contracts/common/Initializable.sol :  Not a big deal because library contracts' states are meaningless, but it'd still be nice if  Initializable  provided a way for these library contracts to be initialized on creation (e.g. by providing a constructor that sets  initializationBlock )      ENSSubdomainRegistrar.createNameAndPoint()  should accept an  owner  parameter  aragonOS/contracts/ens/ENSSubdomainRegistrar.sol :  Mirror  createName() 's interface and increase flexibility      Nomenclature:  aragonOS/contracts/common/EVMCallScript.sol :  EVMCallScriptRunner.LogScriptCall  event should be named  ScriptCall  to adhere to the same pattern as all other events (no  Log  prefix)    aragonOS/contracts/kernel/IKernel.sol :  Function names and arguments have a naming mismatch; names are called in terms of  permission s whereas arguments are always called in terms of  role s  ChangePermissionManager  event could have its  manager  parameter renamed as  newManager  for clarity       Comments:   aragonOS/contracts/apps/AppProxy.sol  and  aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol :  Fallback function: a note indicating that no  return  statement is needed for  delegatedFwd()  to return a  bytes32  value would be nice (it is puzzling at first glance why the comments say they return data but the function signatures and bodies don't contain  return s; it's additionally puzzling because Solidity disallows fallbacks from returning). Also, I believe it's more than just a  bytes32  being returned now (post Byzantium); it should be the entire return?    aragonOS/contracts/common/DelegateProxy.sol :  Would be nice to have an  @returns  comment    aragonOS/contracts/common/IForwarder.sol :  Would be nice to have some comments documenting the interface    aragonOS/contracts/common/Initializable.sol :  initialized() :  Function to be called by subclassed contract to signal it has been initialized.  may better reflect the intended usage of  initialized()    aragonOS/contracts/kernel/IKernel.sol :  Might be nice to move some of the comments detailing functions from  aragonOS/contracts/kernel/Kernel.sol  to the interface contract    aragonOS/contracts/kernel/Kernel.sol :  It may be useful to have a detailed example for each complex mapping, e.g:  mapping (address => mapping (address => mapping (bytes32 => bool))) permissions  could have  (entity => (app => (role => hasPermission)))  Remove all instances of  parent  and replace with  manager  setAppCode() : suggest changing  @dev  comment to  @dev Changes implementation address for all installed apps with \\ _appId`.

            "text": "General  Given that most storage arrays in the apps are never iterated, they could be implemented with  mapping (bytes32 => ...) s instead, where the key is  keccak256('<type>', currentNumOfType) . The main advantage of this is being able to avoid any index manipulation targeted for humans (i.e. forcing some arrays to start at  1  because  0  doesn't make intuitive sense). Also, a pseudorandom  bytes32  value arguably makes more sense as an identifier than an incrementing  uint . Clients could listen to the logs (or rebuild the hashes, if  currentNumOfType  is known) to build their UIs.

It may be beneficial for both cases to match so as to avoid unexpected behaviour for users. One way of accomplishing this would be to cache a one-time payment if it cannot be immediately executed.    setBudget()  should check that  _amount  is greater than or equal to the current period's expenses  Changing a budget to be smaller than the current period's expenses will likely be confusing for clients and should be avoided    Remove payment date check from  executePayment()  and  receiverExecutePayment()  require(nextPaymentTime(_paymentId) <= getTimestamp())  is already checked in  _executePayment()    view  getters can be made  external  nextPaymentTime()  (l402):  payment  should be a  storage  variable  nextPaymentTime() 's casting from uint256 to uint64 (l410) should have an associated  require(nextPayment <= MAX_UINT64)  getTimestamp()  should return  uint64  to conform with other dates  _canMakePayment()  should be  view      TokenManager  aragon-apps/apps/token-manager/contracts/TokenManager.sol :  transferable  and  logHolders  could be grouped together to save some storage  assignVested()  could be renamed to  assignVesting()  to clarify that it creates a vesting for an entity rather than assigning already vested tokens to an entity  allHolders()  and  spendableBalanceOf()  could be made external  isBalanceIncreaseAllowed()  should use  .add() :  return token.balanceOf(_receiver).add(_inc) <= maxAccountTokens  transferableBalance() 's  _time  parameter should be of  uint64  for consistency with other dates  calculateNonVestedTokens()  should sanitize its time inputs:  require(start <= cliff && cliff <= vesting)  calculateNonVestedTokens() 's  vestedTokens  calculation could be simplified to  uint256 vestedToken = tokens.mul((time - start) / (vesting - start))  (assuming sanity checks above were performed)  _assign()  should also call  _logHolderIfNeeded(_receiver)      Voting  aragon-apps/apps/voting/contracts/Voting.sol :  Add veto role: give an entity the ability to decide a vote unianimously  Example use case: give certain entities (e.g. President) extra power to decide votes more quickly (allows them to have more power without being assigned other permissions).  Example use case: in a stalemate due to not reaching  minAcceptQuorumPct , a DAO may want to restart a vote with a lower  minAcceptQuorumPct . At that point, the previous vote could be vetoed to be unsuccessful to allow a new vote to start right away, rather than having to wait for it to expire.    Allow  minAcceptQuorumPct  to be provided when creating a new vote  The main utility I could gather from allowing this parameter to be modified was that a DAO may choose different levels of importance for different votes (of the same type, i.e. time and required support), where size of quorum is a proxy for importance. However, given the current implementation, it would require multiple steps to change the  minAcceptQuorumPct  for a single vote (you'd have to change it, create a vote, and then change it back).  Implementing this could be done via an overload, storing the quorum percentage given on initialization as the default percentage.  forward()  should always use the default percentage.

We were very impressed with the\nquality of the code. It is without question one of the most advanced smart contract systems in\nthe space and makes extensive use of many new functionalities within Solidity and at the EVM\nlevel. Especially notable is the secure way to deploy a core controller that adds upgradability,\nthe access control pattern (ACL) and its flexible execution engines.\n\n\nWe spent 3 weeks in March reviewing the code and found 1 critical issue, 3 high severity\nissues, 4 medium severity issues and 27 low severity issues. We also made 39 comments to\nthe code about things that could be improved or at least things that we believe require a\nclarification or a deeper look. The critical issue, if exploited, could stop all Aragon DApps\ndeployed if it was not corrected.\n\n\nAfter our deep dive into the code, we discussed the issues with the Aragon team and they\nworked to fix all the issues throughout April. We reviewed these fixes and can say that the\nAragon team has corrected all of the important security issues that we found.\n\n\nThe biggest worry we have with this framework is the possible misunderstanding of this\nframework by the developers that decide to use it to deploy their DApps. We strongly\nrecommend that all Aragon DApp developers, especially those that are early pioneers, review\nthe code, try to understand how it works, and do not treat it as a black box. We recommend\nthat the Aragon core team and community contributors make a special effort to add useful\nclarifications in the code. Better documentation will greatly contribute to the high level of\nsecurity that this framework is designed to provide.\n\n\nFrom the architectural perspective, we believe that this code base is an incredibly well designed\nfirst iteration. However, after the first set of DApps are developed on top of this framework, it is\nlikely that more improvements and refactors will need to be done to accommodate the desired\nusage of the DApp developers.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n1.

Introduction\n\n\n1.1 About this review\n\n\nThe primary focus of this audit was to analyze the aragonOS contracts. We focused our efforts\non the Solidity contracts located at \nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/v3.0.1/contracts\n\n(bf434fc6a0720bff091a5d3abfc1190e5ec3f342)\n\n\nFor the aragon-apps we started at commit:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/3542fea317c641f801cef6ca365f52fda97c7323\n\n\nWe concluded the audit by reviewing only the changes related to the initially found issues up to\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/be4522b264d2224279fbfe582f424f3c6c8d3c9b\n\nand\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/05bf9e858e5234429f13bda22b7db9f79cba2f9e\n.\n\n\nWe assembled a multidisciplinary team to get deep into the project and find as many issues as\nwe could in the three weeks we set aside to review this code.\n\n\nScope: Solidity Contracts\n\n\nWe critically analyzed the aragonOS contracts and aragon-app contracts to understand the system. We ran local test deployments and created proof of concept apps to try out the aragon system first hand.\n\n\nSolidity audits are something our core team is most experienced in. We followed our pattern of searching for bugs and performing a critical review to ensure the code matches the intentions of the developers.\n\n\nOut of Scope:\n\n\nAs the name implies, the aragonOS is meant to be a foundation layer for business application built on its ACL and kernel components. The following was not in scope:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActual business applications and real world scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation for business use cases (still underway when this review began)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser interface and user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeployment process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the team went deep into solidity, we can not assume there are\nzero errors in the solidity compiler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Disclaimer\n\n\nThis document includes opinions and recommendations. All the opinions are our own and\nindependent of the Aragon team. We found issues in the Solidity code and general design of\nsystem but that does not mean that we found all the issues.\n\n\n1.3 Team Introduction\n\n\n\nJordi Baylina < jordi@baylina.cat >\n\n@jbaylina\n\nOver 30 years experience as a developer, and over two years spent researching Ethereum.

Please note that this PR also includes the token recoverability functionality.\n\n\nThe way it has been solved is by always accepting \nsend\n and \ntransfer\n calls with ETH and then creating a mechanism for token recovery including ETH. This mechanism may complicate the contracts aimed to receive ETH by default, and any other application that will have to define a token. Aragon App developers must be very aware of this mechanism.\n\n\nThis mechanism may also bring some issues with clients using the \neth_estimateGas\n function.\n\n\nPlease, also note that this functionality was not part of this code review and has not been fully reviewed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.

            "text": "In February, Aragon asked us to do a code review for the aragonOS framework as well as the\nFinance, Vault, Voting and Token Manager applications. We were very impressed with the\nquality of the code. It is without question one of the most advanced smart contract systems in\nthe space and makes extensive use of many new functionalities within Solidity and at the EVM\nlevel. Especially notable is the secure way to deploy a core controller that adds upgradability,\nthe access control pattern (ACL) and its flexible execution engines.  We spent 3 weeks in March reviewing the code and found 1 critical issue, 3 high severity\nissues, 4 medium severity issues and 27 low severity issues. We also made 39 comments to\nthe code about things that could be improved or at least things that we believe require a\nclarification or a deeper look. The critical issue, if exploited, could stop all Aragon DApps\ndeployed if it was not corrected.  After our deep dive into the code, we discussed the issues with the Aragon team and they\nworked to fix all the issues throughout April. We reviewed these fixes and can say that the\nAragon team has corrected all of the important security issues that we found.  The biggest worry we have with this framework is the possible misunderstanding of this\nframework by the developers that decide to use it to deploy their DApps. We strongly\nrecommend that all Aragon DApp developers, especially those that are early pioneers, review\nthe code, try to understand how it works, and do not treat it as a black box. We recommend\nthat the Aragon core team and community contributors make a special effort to add useful\nclarifications in the code. Better documentation will greatly contribute to the high level of\nsecurity that this framework is designed to provide.  From the architectural perspective, we believe that this code base is an incredibly well designed\nfirst iteration. However, after the first set of DApps are developed on top of this framework, it is\nlikely that more improvements and refactors will need to be done to accommodate the desired\nusage of the DApp developers.",

We focused our efforts\non the Solidity contracts located at  https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/v3.0.1/contracts \n(bf434fc6a0720bff091a5d3abfc1190e5ec3f342)  For the aragon-apps we started at commit:  https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/3542fea317c641f801cef6ca365f52fda97c7323  We concluded the audit by reviewing only the changes related to the initially found issues up to https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/be4522b264d2224279fbfe582f424f3c6c8d3c9b \nand  https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/05bf9e858e5234429f13bda22b7db9f79cba2f9e .  We assembled a multidisciplinary team to get deep into the project and find as many issues as\nwe could in the three weeks we set aside to review this code.  Scope: Solidity Contracts  We critically analyzed the aragonOS contracts and aragon-app contracts to understand the system. We ran local test deployments and created proof of concept apps to try out the aragon system first hand.  Solidity audits are something our core team is most experienced in. We followed our pattern of searching for bugs and performing a critical review to ensure the code matches the intentions of the developers.  Out of Scope:  As the name implies, the aragonOS is meant to be a foundation layer for business application built on its ACL and kernel components. The following was not in scope:    Actual business applications and real world scenarios.    Documentation for business use cases (still underway when this review began)    User interface and user experience.    Deployment process.    Even though the team went deep into solidity, we can not assume there are\nzero errors in the solidity compiler.",

However if the proxy instance is registered with the kernel, you can fetch the app addr with  kernel.getApp() . Thus if you register a  AppProxyPinned  instance with the kernel, then anywhere  kernel.getApp  is called to fetch the app address, it can be replaced with a new address by calling  kernel.setApp . So the app isn't really pinned because it is replaceable.

The worry is that this odd feature could be exploited by attackers. Here is an example:   A deployer deploys a contract  Attacker creates a proposal to send all funds to address X. The quorum for this\nwill be zero.  The attacker votes for this proposal using another address so that it can be\nexecuted later. But also needs to vote for it in the same block as the vote\ndeadline is also 0.  The deployer initializes the contract. and gives it access to move funds from a\nvault.

Description   Even though the likelihood of this event is \u201cvery low\u201d, we consider this issue of medium severity, to give an special attention to it.   There are concerns about criteria changes in future solidity versions. The control that developers have on where the variables are stored is quite limited. Dependency on the multi-inheritance order on the definition of the class may variate the way state variables are stored.  As an example, in Kernel, If we swap  KernelStorage  and  Initializable  it would break compatibility.

Comments   May be a good idea if the  isValidBump  does not check the major version to allow patch fixing of previous ones.

Comments   Using an assembly call to the  ACLOracle  and checking if the call succeeded or failed, will provide consistent handling of the params.

Inherent ethereum flaw.       Description   If an organization using the Finance app owes more money out to receivers than it has, then receivers may begin racing each other hoping to get to any funds first as soon as they are available using the  receiverExecutePayment  function.     Comments   Avoiding these kinds of races can be done by defining and implementing a better policy for payments when there is not enough money. Maybe prioritising older receivers or the ones with more reputation. Or may be allowing only to withdraw a portion of the funds. Any of these solutions may require a large development effort for something that may be complex and not worthy. So keeping the code as is, is probably the best decision at this stage, but users of this contract should be aware of this flaw.     [V015-LW] Forward is too permissive     Location  Severity  Status      https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/to ken-manager/contracts/Toke nManager.sol#L182  Low  Not Fixed No action will be taken. Documentation issue.       Description   There are some great use cases for forwarding evm script functions. But this functionality should not be included as a general default with the TokenManager. It violates the single responsibility principle. It allows a function to return very different outputs.     Comments   This functionality might be better placed outside the TokenManager in a contract specifically designed for the specific use cases it is intended for. Creating multiple instances of employees or IDs are two examples.     [V016-LW] Should not permit anything if no Kernel or ACL is defined     Location  Severity  Status      https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ apps/AragonApp.sol#L29  Low  Not Fixed See: https://github.com/aragon/aragon OS/issues/325 Documentation issue.       Description   The Kernel and ACL are central to the operation of Aragon apps and so apps should be able to expect that they are defined. If the Kernel or ACL are not defined, then nothing should be allowed.     Comments   Aragon\u2019s argument about this issue is that an application should be able to run in standalone mode (Without an ACL defined). This seems a little dangerous (but not an issue by itself) since this permits any operation when this variable is set to zero (the initial value). In any case, this should be very well documented in the code and in the usage handbook.

This means that you can not use the re-entrancy safe  transfer  and  send  methods provided by solidity to call an AragonApp. You would need to manually limit the gas with  vault.call.gas(16000).value(msg.value)() .   This issue, has been fixed recently in  https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/281  . Please note that this PR also includes the token recoverability functionality.  The way it has been solved is by always accepting  send  and  transfer  calls with ETH and then creating a mechanism for token recovery including ETH. This mechanism may complicate the contracts aimed to receive ETH by default, and any other application that will have to define a token. Aragon App developers must be very aware of this mechanism.  This mechanism may also bring some issues with clients using the  eth_estimateGas  function.  Please, also note that this functionality was not part of this code review and has not been fully reviewed.",

If these permissions fall into the wrong hands, they can break the entire DAO and any apps that share an ACL/Kernel. Sometimes these permissions are given to Apps within the DAO.

When this  scriptExecutor  is the  DeployDelegateScript  executor this  cache  variable will potentially conflict with the calling contracts storage in slot  0 , thus potentially leading to storage corruption and unexpected state.   With the current AragonStorage layout, there is no conflict because cache is a mapping and thus stored in slot  keccak256(\u20180\u2019 . index)  and the first storage variable in AragonStorage is  IKernel  and stored in slot  0 .

A generic forward action will create a vote with the provided execution script and empty metadata.\n\n\nWhen a vote is created a reference to the previous block number is saved as the snapshot block for the vote. The reason the previous block number is used is to avoid double voting in the same block the vote is created.

In case a vote is against, it will add it to the \nnay\n counter.\n\n\nAfter any casted votes, the contract checks whether a vote already has the complete support to be executed (even if everyone else voted against, the vote would still be approved), in that case the vote is executed and closed.\n\n\nExecuting voting\n\n\nvotingApp.executeVote(uint256 _voteId)\n\n\n\n\nAfter a vote has expired time-wise (and no more votes are allowed), the result of the vote can be executed by anyone if it was approved.

Moreover you should pass to the smart contract the actual number, not the scientific notation so:\n- 10^16 \u00a0 is  10000000000000000 \u00a0 (or 1 with 16 zeros)\n- 10^18   is  1000000000000000000  (or 1 with 18 zeros)  Here are a few percentages you can use     Percentage  Scientific Notation  actual input passed to the smart contract      0%  0  0    1%  10^16  10000000000000000    10%  10*10^16  100000000000000000    20%  20*10^16  200000000000000000    25%  25*10^16  250000000000000000    50%  50*10^16  500000000000000000    60%  60*10^16  600000000000000000    70%  70*10^16  700000000000000000    75%  75*10^16  750000000000000000    100%  100*10^16  1000000000000000000",

The sales that can be performed are simple capped sales with variable pricing over time. By tweaking some parameters, different sale dynamics can be achieved.\n\n\nMore complex sale types can be implemented as 3rd party applications.\n\n\nDependencies and permissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToken Manager\n: On initialization it requires a reference to a \nToken Manager\n instance. One fundraising app instance is only able to 'sell' the underlying token managed by its \nToken Manager\n. \nThe fundraising app must be granted permissions to mint tokens on the Token Manager\n. The Token Manager must have been initialized in \nNative mode\n so it can arbitrarily mint new tokens (See \nToken Manager spec\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVault\n: A reference to a \nvault\n is also required on initialization. However, there is no direct interaction with the vault, it is just used as the address where sale proceeds are deposited (vanilla ERC20 transfers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth parameters are not modifiable after initialization.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInverse pricing\n: Given that there is no native support for floating point numbers in Solidity, we need to introduce the concept of inverse pricing to allow for prices that are below 1. Token decimals must be taken into account when setting prices.\n\n\n\n\nWhen inverse pricing is \nfalse\n in a sale, price means how many input tokens must be payed for each token being bought. That means the amount of tokens bought is calculated as \nboughtTokens = payedTokens / price\n.\n\n\nWhen inverse pricing is \ntrue\n, price means how many bought tokens are acquired per input token. \nboughtTokens = payedTokens * price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice periods\n:\n\n\n\n\nA sale will go through one or multiple periods during its lifecycle.\n\n\nPeriods determine what the price is at any given moment during the sale.\n\n\nA period starts at the same timestamp when the previous period ended (or in the case of the first one, when the sale starts).\n\n\nA period has an initial and final price. If they are not the same, price for a given timestamp is linearly interpolated in function of time.\n\n\nSales can have up to 50 periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaps\n: By default all sales are capped on two aspects, uncapping a sale can be done by setting it to a very large number. Setting one or both caps to UINT256_MAX should be interpreted by the client as being uncapped on that aspect.\n\n\nMax raised\n: Maximum amount of the token being raised that one sale accepts.\n\n\nMax sold\n: Maximum amount of tokens a sale can sell (max tokens minted).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSale lifecycle\n\n\nCreation\n\n\nfundraising.newSale(...)\n\n\n\n\nAll sale parameters are set on initialization and cannot be changed. After a sale has been created, there is the option to force closing the sale (requires permissions).\n\n\nSale parameters:\n\n\n\n\nInvestor: Address of the entity allowed to buy in the sale. If the provided address is the 0th address (\n0x0000...\n), then the sale is considered public and any address can buy.\n\n\nRaised token: Address of the token used for buy in the sale.\n\n\nMaximum raised: As explained in caps section.\n\n\nMaximum sold: As explained in caps section.\n\n\nMinimum buy: Minimum amount of raised token for a valid purchase.\n\n\nIs inverse price: Whether sale prices are expressed as inverse or not (as explained above).\n\n\nSale start time: Timestamp for the start of the first period.\n\n\nPeriod ends array: Array of timestamps when each period ends (Minimum 1).\n\n\nPrices array: Array of prices for periods. Even though each period has two values, it is a one dimensional array. Example: \n[2, 3, 3, 5]\n means Period 1(\ninitial price\n = 2, \nfinal price\n = 3) and Period 2 (\ninitial price\n = 3, \nfinal price\n = 5)\n\n\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nOn every buy, the contract will calculate the price for the current timestamp based on the sale periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a given buy results in the sale capping (either maxRaised or maxSold), the contract will refund the buyer the amount contributed over the cap and the sale is closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter every individual buy, all funds are sent to the vault. The fundraising contract should never have funds in between buys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy entrypoints\n\n\nTwo methods are allowed for buying in sales:\n\n\nERC20\n\n\nfundraising.transferAndBuy(uint256 saleId, uint256 payedTokens)\n\n\n\n\nRequires the sender to have already created an ERC20 allowance equal or greater than \npayedTokens\n (could actually be less in the scenario some tokens are not allowed for cap reasons).\n\n\nERC677\n\n\nfundraising.buyTokens(uint256 saleId) // called by token\n\n\n\n\nRequires the sender to make a \ntransferAndCall()\n as in the \nERC677 standard\n (still evolving and being discussed), setting the fundraising app as receiver and adding the correct data payload.\n\n\nRaising ether can be done by setting the raised token to an EtherToken (ideally the one used by the \nFinance app\n for discoverability). Given that aragonOS' EtherToken implementation conforms to ERC677, buying with ether can be done by wrapping the ether using \netherToken.wrap()\n and then doing a \ntransferAndCall(...)\n or using the shortcut \nwrapAndCall(...)\n which performs both actions.\n\n\nPlease note that this section is subject to change as the \nERC677 discussion\n evolves.\n\n\nClosing sale\n\n\nfundraising.closeSale(uint256 _saleId)\n\n\n\n\nThe sale is automatically closed either when a cap is reached or when the last period of the sale is over.\n\n\nAttempting to buy in a closed sale will fail.\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\n\n\nThere is no concept of non-successful sale for lack of funding, therefore there are no refunds.\n\n\nIn private sales, only one investor can buy.

Budgets are set in a token per token basis. By default no token has a budget, which means unlimited spending is allowed.\n\n\nOnce a budget has been set for a token, the Finance app will only allow the budgeted amount of tokens to be spent for that period.\n\n\nInitialization\n\n\nInitializing a Finance app requires the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nVault:\n a reference to a \nVault\n instance that the Finance app will use for depositing and spending tokens.

A single execution can result in multiple transactions if the payment hasn't been executed in time. To prevent it going out of gas when many transfers are due, a maximum amount of transfers are performed per execution (multiple executions could be needed in some instances).\n\n\nPayments can always be executed by its recipient, but there is also an additional role to the Finance app that allows another entity to execute the payment (recipient gets the funds in both instances).\n\n\nFor payments whose token is the known EtherToken, instead of doing a token transfer, it will directly transfer ether to the recipient.\n\n\nA payment execution can fail in case the organization is out of budget for the payment token for that particular accounting period, or the organization doesn't have enough token balance.\n\n\nDisabling payments\n\n\nfinance.setPaymentDisabled(uint256 _paymentId, bool _disabled)\n\n\n\n\nAt any time, a payment can be disabled by an authorized entity.

Introduction\n\n\nAragon is an application for creating and governing organizations - such as clubs, corporations, nonprofits, and open source projects - on \nEthereum\n-compatible \nblockchain\n networks. Aragon currently supports creating organizations on the main Ethereum network (\u201cmainnet\u201d) and the Rinkeby test network (\u201ctestnet\u201d).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can find more information about the Aragon project, decentralized organizations, governance, and other related topics in \nthe Aragon wiki\n.\n\n\n\n\n0.1 Anatomy of an Aragon organization\n\n\nAn Aragon organization is made up of software programs known as \u201csmart contracts\u201d. While traditional legal contracts are ultimately enforced by coercion and the ability to physically seize assets in case one party to the contract does not fulfill their obligations, smart contracts are enforced by computers that ensure the contract is executed exactly as it is programmed. This \u201cself-enforcing\u201d property of smart contracts can reduce the risk involved in certain types of contracts.\n\n\nThe smart contract system Aragon is built on is called \naragonOS\n. This system ensures that only authorized accounts and contracts (what Aragon refers to as \u201centities\u201d) have permission to perform specific actions in an organization. The same way that a legal contract defines what rights and obligations a party to the contract has, the aragonOS smart contracts define what rights and obligations entities have in an Aragon organization.\n\n\nEach Aragon organization has apps that can be \u201cinstalled\u201d on aragonOS. These apps extend the functionality of the organization and give members new ways of interacting with each other and the organization itself. Some examples of applications that can be added to Aragon organizations are the Token Manager, Voting, Finance, and Permissions apps. Anyone can develop their own app, add it to their own organization, and publish it for others to use as well.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can find more information about the technical details of how Aragon works, including how to develop your own Aragon app, in the \nAragon Developer Portal\n.\n\n\n\n\n1. Prerequisites\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to a working laptop or desktop computer with a decent internet connection, you will need the following to start using Aragon:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp-to-date \nBrave\n, \nChrome\n/\nChromium\n, \nFirefox\n, or \nOpera\n web browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Ethereum provider such as \nMetaMask\n and a compatible Ethereum wallet such as \nLedger\n or \nTrezor\n if your Ethereum provider either does not have key management (\"wallet\") functionality built-in or you prefer not to use the built-in wallet functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Aragon on mainnet, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Main Ethereum Network. You will then need to load your wallet with enough ETH to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. ETH can be acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange that lists ETH. As a rough estimate of how much ETH you should start with, multiply 20,000,000 times the \ncurrent \u201cstandard\u201d gas price\n times 0.000000001 to find out how much ETH you need. For example, at a current standard gas price of 10 gwei, you should start with 0.2 ETH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Aragon on testnet, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Rinkeby Test Network. You will then need to load your wallet with test ether for the Ethereum Rinkeby test network. This test ether is used to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. You can try the \nRinkeby faucet\n or post your Ethereum Rinkeby testnet address in the \n#faucet channel on Aragon Chat\n to receive test ether for free. Please wait patiently for an Aragon team member to see your message if you post your faucet request in the Aragon Chat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Templates\n\n\nTemplates are pre-configured smart contracts for different types of organizations. You can use the templates that are included with Aragon or create your own. Aragon currently includes two templates: Democracy and Multisig. This section will walk you through examples of how you can use these templates as a starting point for your organization.\n\n\n2.1 Create a new Democracy organization\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Navigate to \nhttps://app.aragon.org\n in your web browser\n\n\n\n\nSelect which network you want to use to create your organization then click \"Create a new organization\".\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Select \u201cToken project with Democracy\u201d then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\n\nA \u201cToken project with Democracy\u201d is an organization where the vote cast by a token holder is weighted proportionally to their ownership stake of tokens minted by the organization. For example, if a tokenholder owns 5% of the tokens minted by the organization then their vote will count as 5% of the total votes on a given proposal.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Claim a domain name then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\n\nAragon uses the \nEthereum Name Service\n (ENS) to assign names to organizations.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis name currently cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Set the parameters of your Democracy organization then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n\u201cSupport\u201d is the number for what percent of the tokens that participated in a vote must approve a proposal for that proposal to pass. For example, if \u201cSupport\u201d is set to 51%, then 51% of tokens that vote on a proposal must approve the proposal for it to pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMin. Quorum\n\n\n\u201cMin. Quorum\u201d is short for \u201cMinimum Acceptance Quorum. \u201cMin. Quorum\u201d is the number for what percent of the total outstanding supply of tokens must approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. For example, if the Min. Quorum is set to 20%, then 20% of the outstanding token supply must vote to approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. If a vote does not make quorum, then it will fail, even if more tokens voted to approve the proposal than voted against it. For example, if the Min. Quorum is set to 20% and 10% of the outstanding token supply votes against the proposal but only 15% vote in support, then the proposal will fail because it has not reached the Min. Quorum threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVote Duration\n\n\n\u201cVote Duration\u201d is the length of time that the vote will be open for participation. For example, if the Vote Duration is set to 24 H, then tokenholders have 24 hours to participate in the vote. After the 24 hours is over, if the vote has not been approved by a majority of tokenholders and/or does not make quorum, then the vote will automatically fail. If the vote makes quorum and receives approval by a majority of tokenholders by the end of the Vote Duration, then the vote will automatically pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Choose token name and symbol then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe token name and symbol currently cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Sign organization creation transactions\n\n\n\nNow you need to sign two transactions in MetaMask to create your organization.\n\n\nOpen MetaMask if the wallet window does not open automatically. After the first transaction is confirmed, the second transaction may show up in MetaMask as a transaction with an \u201cunapproved\u201d label, indicating that it needs to be signed. Click the transaction to open and sign it.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBe careful not to close your browser window while creating your organization. If your browser window closes after signing the first transaction to create the organization but before the second transaction appears, then it will be difficult to pick up where you left off after you re-open your browser window. We are working on \nmaking it easier to recover\n from browser closures (due to a crash or otherwise) during the organization creation process in general. Please be advised that ETH used to pay gas for the first organization creation transaction will be \"stuck\" until we implement an easy way to recover and send the second and final organization creation transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.7 Click \u201cGet Started\u201d\n\n\n\nYour new Democracy organization is ready to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Explore the Democracy organization\n\n\n2.2.1 Home app\n\n\n\nThe Home app welcomes you to your organization and offers you several options for different actions you can take. You can also use the menu on the left-hand side of the screen to view the different apps that are currently installed for your organization. Aragon currently has the Token Manager, Voting, Finance, and Permissions apps installed, with an App Center coming soon.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Token Manager app\n\n\n\nThe Token Manager is the app you use to mint new tokens and assign them to yourself or other entities.\n\n\n\n\nYou can mint new tokens by following these steps:\n\n\n2.2.2.1 Click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d button\n\n\n\nEnter the address of the recipient of the tokens and the number of new tokens you want to mint and assign to that address, then click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Create vote to assign tokens\n\n\n\nEven though you are the only tokenholder, the Democracy organization still requires a tokenholder vote for every action. Click \u201cSign Transaction\u201d to sign the transaction that creates a new vote to assign the new token you want to mint.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nCreating a vote will automatically make your account vote \u201cYes\u201d on the proposal. You can change your vote by opening the vote in the Voting app, clicking the \u201cNo\u201d button, and signing the transaction to change your vote to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.3 Sign and send transaction to create the \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d vote\n\n\n\nAfter clicking \u201cSign Transaction\u201d, a notification will pop-up in MetaMask. Open MetaMask, then sign and send the transaction to create the vote.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.4 Check out the newest member of your organization\n\n\n\nSince you are the only tokenholder, the vote will automatically pass and the token will automatically be assigned to the entity you added in 2.2.2.1. A good start to a new Democracy organization!\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf a vote is cast that causes the quorum to be equal to the support required (e.g. 60% support with 60% quorum) then the vote will execute automatically. If the quorum is less than the support required (e.g. 60% support with 40% quorum) then additional \"no\" votes could still stop the vote from being passed, so the vote will remain open until the duration is reached. After the vote ends, the result must be executed manually by one of the token holders in the organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Voting app\n\n\n\nThe Voting app makes it easy for you to poll your fellow tokenholders about their position on an infinite range of topics. Votes initiated by other Aragon apps also show up in the Voting app. For example, assigning tokens using the Token Manager or moving funds from the Finance app are each actions that require a vote by tokenholders in a Democracy organization.\n\n\n\n\nFollow these steps to create a new vote and poll your community about a topic you care about:\n\n\n2.2.3.1 Click \u201cNew Vote\u201d\n\n\n\nFill out the question you want to poll your community about and click \u201cBegin Vote\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3.2 Sign transaction to create new vote\n\n\n\nClick the \u201cCreate transaction\u201d button, then open your MetaMask wallet to sign and send the transaction.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3.3 Ask the other tokenholders to review and vote on the proposal\n\n\n\nRally your fellow tokenholders outside the app - for example, by email, forum, chat room, or good old fashioned face-to-face - and ask them to review and vote on the proposal. Tokenholders can visit the Voting app to see the list of open votes and cast their ballot accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3.4 Other tokenholders cast their vote\n\n\n\nIn this case, the other tokenholder in the organization supports deploying the organization to mainnet. They sent a follow-up email saying that security audit came back with good results, so they will vote \u201cyes\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3.5 Review the vote\n\n\n\nSince there are only two token-holders in this organization, and the Support parameter is set to 51%, the unanimous vote on the question of whether or not the organization should be deployed to mainnet next week has resulted in an approved (or \u201cExecuted\u201d) vote. A vote with a status of \u201cExecuted\u201d does not need any further action to be taken.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Settings app\n\n\n\nThe Settings app is where you can find the internal addresses for your organization, as well as troubleshoot issues you are having with Aragon. If you want to send ETH or tokens to your organization, make sure to use the Finance app address. When using testnet you also have the ability to request test tokens, which will be sent to the organization\u2019s Finance app.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Finance app\n\n\n\nThe Finance app is the app that provides tokenholders with access to the funds held by their organization. The Finance app shows the current balance in ETH and tokens as well as the transaction history of the organization. You can also use the Finance app to initiate a new transfer of funds.\n\n\n\n\nFollow these steps to create a new transfer from the Finance app:\n\n\n2.2.5.1 Send ETH or tokens to your organization\n\n\n\n\n\nOn mainnet\n\n\nGo to the Finance app and click the \u201cNew Transfer\u201d button. On the \u201cDeposit\u201d tab, enter the token you want to deposit, the amount, and an optional reference note. Click \u201cSubmit deposit\u201d to complete the transfer. About a minute or so after your transaction is confirmed, the funds will appear in the Finance app of your organization. You can then create a new transfer to withdraw these funds to another address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn testnet\n\n\nGo to the Settings app and press the \u201cRequest test tokens\u201d button. Open MetaMask to sign and send the transaction. About a minute or so after your transaction is confirmed, test tokens will be sent to the Finance app address of your organization. You can then create a new transfer to send these tokens to another address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5.2 Click \u201cNew Transfer\u201d to initiate a new transfer from the Finance app\n\n\n\nGo to the \"Withdrawal\" tab then enter the address of the recipient and the amount of tokens to send them, along with an optional reference note about what the transfer is for. Then click \u201cSubmit Transfer\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5.3 Sign the transaction to create the New Transfer vote\n\n\n\nAs mentioned before, all actions in the Democracy organization require a vote by tokenholders. Click \u201cSign Transaction\u201d then open MetaMask to sign and send the transaction that creates the New Transfer vote.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5.4 Ask the other tokenholders in the organization to review and vote on the transfer\n\n\n\nThe payment is intended to compensate another tokenholder in the organization for design work they did, so they waste no time reviewing and voting to approve the transfer.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5.5 The vote transaction is signed and sent to approve the transfer\n\n\n\nAfter confirmation, the transfer will execute.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5.6 Review the transfer in the Finance app\n\n\n\nGo back to the Finance app to see a record of the transfer and a link to the transaction record on the blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Create a Multisig organization\n\n\n2.3.1 Navigate to \nhttps://app.aragon.org\n in your web browser\n\n\n\nSelect which network you want to use to create your organization then click \"Create a new organization\".\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Select \u201cToken project with Multisig\u201d then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\n\nA \u201cToken project with Multisig\u201d is an organization where the resources of the organization are controlled by m-of-n members of a multisig contract, where n is 100% of tokenholders and m is the Min. Quorum percentage of tokenholders that must approve a vote for it to pass. For example, in a 2-of-2 multisig DAO, two signatures from two different specified accounts are required for a proposal to pass.\n\n\nIf more tokens are minted for additional accounts, then the number of signatures required may increase as well to maintain the required Min. Quorum. For example, starting with a 2-of-3 multisig (66% Min. Quorum) and issuing one token to a new account will make the DAO a 3-of-4 multisig, issuing one more token to yet another new account will make the DAO a 4-of-5 multisig, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Claim a domain name then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\n\nAragon uses the \nEthereum Name Service\n (ENS) to assign names to organizations.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis name currently cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Enter the accounts and the parameters of the multisig contract\n\n\n\nFirst enter the addresses of the accounts that you want to be members of the multisig. Then set the number of signatures out of those accounts that will be required to approve votes in the multisig. For example, you can enter three accounts and require any two of their signatures to approve a vote (\u201c2-of-3\u201d). Up to six signers can be added during the organization creation process. If you need additional signers, you can add them after the organization is created by assigning a token to each of the accounts you want to join the organization.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Choose token name and symbol then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe token name and symbol currently cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Sign organization creation transactions\n\n\n\nNow you need to sign two transactions in MetaMask to create your organization. Open MetaMask if the wallet window does not open automatically. After the first transaction is confirmed, the second transaction may show up in MetaMask as a transaction with an \u201cunapproved\u201d label, indicating that it needs to be signed. Click the transaction to open and sign it.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere is \nan issue\n with some Ethereum provider configurations that causes the browser window to crash and the organization creation process to fail after the first transaction, with no easy way to pick up where you left off to send the second and final transaction to create the organization. We are working on a fix for this specific issue that is causing the browser to crash, and we are also working on \nmaking it easier to recover\n from browser closures (due to a crash or otherwise) during the organization creation process in general. Please be advised that ETH used to pay gas for the first organization creation transaction will be \"stuck\" until we implement an easy way to recover and send the second and final organization creation transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.7 Click \u201cGet Started\u201d\n\n\n\nYour new Multisig organization is ready to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Explore the Multisig organization\n\n\n2.4.1 Home app\n\n\n\nThe Home app welcomes you to your organization and offers you several options for different actions you can take. You can also use the menu on the left-hand side of the screen to view the different apps that are currently installed for your organization. Aragon currently has the Token Manager, Voting, Finance, and Permissions apps installed, with an App Center coming soon.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Token Manager app\n\n\n\nThe Token Manager is the app you use to mint new tokens and assign them to other entities.\n\n\n\n\nYou can mint new tokens by following these steps:\n\n\n2.4.2.1 Click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d button\n\n\n\nEnter the address of the recipient of the tokens and the number of new tokens you want to mint and assign to that address, then click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nEach tokenholder in a multisig organization can only hold one token at a time. An error will be shown and the transaction will fail if you attempt to mint additional tokens for existing tokenholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.2 Create vote to assign tokens\n\n\n\nAs mentioned before, in a Multisig organization m-of-n tokenholders are needed to approve every action. Click \u201cCreate transaction\u201d to create the transaction that creates a new vote to assign the new token you want to mint, then sign the transaction to create the vote.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.3 Review the proposal and decide which way you want to vote\n\n\n\nAfter you have created the proposal to assign the token, you need to cast your vote for the proposal. Open the Voting app and review the proposal. Vote \u201cyes\u201d if you want to approve the proposal or \u201cno\u201d if you want to reject the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.4 Create and sign the vote transaction\n\n\n\nAfter you have decided which way you want to vote, you need to create and sign the vote transaction. Review the details, click the \u201cCreate transaction\u201d button to create the transaction, then sign the transaction to confirm your vote.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.5 Ask the other tokenholders to review and vote on the proposal\n\n\n\nRally your fellow tokenholders outside the app - for example, by email, forum, chat room, or good old fashioned face-to-face - and ask them to review and vote on the proposal. Tokenholders can visit the Voting app to see the list of open votes and cast their ballot accordingly. In this example, the other tokenholder in the organization is happy to add a new member. They sent a follow-up email saying that they'll vote \u201cyes\u201d right away.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.6 Check out the newest member of your Multisig DAO\n\n\n\nAfter the other tokenholder votes to approve the proposal, go back to the Token Manager and see that the member you added is now in the list of tokenholders.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Voting app\n\n\n\nThe voting app makes it easy for you to poll your fellow tokenholders about their position on an infinite range of topics. Votes initiated by other Aragon apps also show up in the Voting app. For example, assigning tokens using the Token Manager or moving funds from the Finance app are each actions that require a vote by tokenholders in a Multisig organization.\n\n\n\n\nFollow these steps to create a new vote and poll your community about a topic you care about:\n\n\n2.4.3.1 Click \u201cNew Vote\u201d\n\n\n\nFill out the question you want to poll your community about and click \u201cBegin Vote\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3.2 Sign transaction to create new vote\n\n\n\nClick the \u201cCreate transaction\u201d button, then open your MetaMask wallet to sign and confirm the transaction.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3.3 Review the proposal and decide which way you want to vote\n\n\n\nAfter you have created the proposal, you need to cast your vote for the proposal. Open the Voting app and review the proposal. Vote \u201cyes\u201d if you want to approve the proposal or \u201cno\u201d if you want to reject the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3.4 Create and sign the vote transaction\n\n\n\nAfter you have decided which way you want to vote, you need to create and sign the vote transaction. Review the details, click the \u201cCreate transaction\u201d button to create the transaction, then sign the transaction to confirm your vote.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3.5 Ask the other tokenholders to review and vote on the proposal\n\n\n\nRally your fellow tokenholders outside the app - for example, by email, forum, chat room, or good old fashioned face-to-face - and ask them to review and vote on the proposal. Tokenholders can visit the Voting app to see the list of open votes and cast their ballot accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3.6 Review the vote\n\n\n\nSince three of three tokenholders are required to vote \u201cyes\u201d to approve a transaction, the unanimous vote on the question of whether or not the organization should sponsor the next AraCon has resulted in an approved (or \u201cExecuted\u201d) vote. A vote with a status of \u201cExecuted\u201d does not need any further action to be taken.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Settings app\n\n\n\nThe Settings app is where you can find the internal addresses for your organization, as well as troubleshoot issues you are having with Aragon. If you want to send ETH or tokens to your organization, make sure to use the Finance app address. When using testnet you also have the ability to request test tokens, which will be sent to the organization\u2019s Finance app.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5 Finance app\n\n\n\nThe Finance app is the app that provides tokenholders with access to the funds held by their organization. The Finance app shows the current balance in ETH and tokens as well as the transaction history of the organization. You can also use the Finance app to initiate a new transfer of funds.\n\n\n\n\nFollow these steps to create a new transfer from the Finance app:\n\n\n2.4.5.1 Send ETH or tokens to your organization\n\n\n\n\n\nOn mainnet\n\n\nGo to the Finance app and click the \u201cNew Transfer\u201d button. On the \u201cDeposit\u201d tab, enter the token you want to deposit, the amount, and an optional reference note. Click \u201cSubmit deposit\u201d to complete the transfer. About a minute or so after your transaction is confirmed, the funds will appear in the Finance app of your organization. You can then create a new transfer to withdraw these funds to another address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn testnet\n\n\nGo to the Settings app and press the \u201cRequest test tokens\u201d button. Open MetaMask to sign and send the transaction. About a minute or so after your transaction is confirmed, test tokens will be sent to the Finance app address of your organization. You can then create a new transfer to send these tokens to another address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5.2 Click \u201cNew Transfer\u201d to initiate a new transfer from the Finance app\n\n\n\nGo to the \"Withdrawal\" tab, the enter the address of the recipient and the amount of tokens to send them, along with an optional reference note about what the transfer is for. Then click \u201cSubmit Transfer\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5.3 Sign the transaction to create the New Transfer vote\n\n\n\nAs mentioned before, all actions in the Multisig organization require a vote by tokenholders. Click \u201cSign Transaction\u201d then open MetaMask to sign and send the transaction that creates the New Transfer vote.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.4 Review the proposal and decide which way you want to vote\n\n\n\nAfter you have created the proposal to transfer the ETH, you need to cast your vote for the proposal. Open the Voting app and review the proposal. Vote \u201cyes\u201d if you want to approve the proposal or \u201cno\u201d if you want to reject the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.5 Create and sign the vote transaction\n\n\n\nAfter you have decided which way you want to vote, you need to create and sign the vote transaction. Review the details, click the \u201cCreate transaction\u201d button to create the transaction, then sign the transaction to confirm your vote.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5.6 Ask the other tokenholders in the organization to review and vote on the transfer\n\n\n\nThe payment is intended to compensate another tokenholder in the organization for documentation work they did, so they waste no time reviewing and voting to approve the transfer. The third tokenholder votes as well. After confirmation, the vote will execute and the transfer will be made.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5.8 Review the transfer in the Finance app\n\n\n\nGo back to the Finance app to see a record of the transfer and a link to the transaction record on the blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Aragon apps\n\n\nAs mentioned in the earlier section \n0.1 Anatomy of an Aragon organization\n, Aragon organizations have the ability to extend their functionality using Aragon apps. The apps that come pre-installed with Democracy and Multisig organizations are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToken Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a Home page, an Apps page, and a Settings page that every Aragon organization comes with by default. In this section we will explore each of these in detail.\n\n\n3.1 Home\n\n\nThe Home page is a simple landing page that shows you the name of the organization you have loaded, as well as different actions that you can take using the pre-installed apps in your organization. For example, in the organization democracy.aragonid.eth we can perform the actions Assign Tokens, Vote, Check Finance, and New Payment. You can also check your network connection status at the bottom of the Home page.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Token Manager\n\n\nThe Token Manager is the app that is used to manage membership and voting power in an organization. To add members to an organization, it\u2019s as easy as minting and assigning a token to them.\n\n\nWith the Democracy template, one token equals one vote, and members can hold as many tokens as are issued to them. With the Multisig template, one token also equals one vote but members cannot hold more than one token each.\n\n\nThis simple process for managing membership and voting power provides the foundation for governing the resources of an organization.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Holders\n\n\nIn the Holders section of the Token Manager app you can see the current list of tokenholders and the balance of organization tokens they each hold. Clicking on the dropdown menu on one of the rows in the list will provide you options for assigning more tokens to that tokenholder or removing tokens from the tokenholder.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Token Info\n\n\nIn the Token Info section you can see information about the token that is used for governance in your organization:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToken supply: how many tokens have been minted in total\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransferable: whether or not the token can be transferred to another entity after it has been assigned\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToken: the token name and token symbol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Ownership Distribution\n\n\nIn the Ownership Distribution section you can see which entities own what percent of the organization\u2019s token supply. This can be helpful as a spot check to see how token ownership is concentrated in the organization.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Assign Tokens\n\n\nIf you click the Assign Tokens button, a panel will open up with text fields for entering the address of the entity you want to assign tokens to and how many tokens you want to assign. After you enter this information, you can click the \u201cAssign tokens\u201d button in the panel to finish completing the action.\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Voting\n\n\nThe Voting app is where you can see all open and past votes. You can also use the Voting app to start a new vote and poll tokenholders in the organization about an issue that is important to you.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Open votes\n\n\nThe \u201cOpen votes\u201d section shows how many open votes there are and cards for each of the open votes, which show how much time is left in the vote, the number of the vote, a snippet of the issue being voted on, and the current status of the vote. You can click \u201cview vote\u201d to expand the card and either cast you vote if you have not voted yet or change your vote if you have already voted.\n\n\nOpen votes - vote not cast\n\n\n\n\nOpen votes - vote already cast\n\n\n\n\nIn each case, the \u201cView vote\u201d panel tells you more detailed information about the status of a vote, such as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime remaining: how much time is left until the vote closes, should no other votes cast cause the vote to automatically pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal support: what percent of the total token supply is needed to vote \u201cyes\u201d for the vote to be valid, and what percent of the total token supply has voted \u201cyes\u201d so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question being voted on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat entity created the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent votes: what percent of voters are required to vote \u201cyes\u201d for the vote to pass, what percent of voters and how many tokens have voted \u201cyes\u201d, and what percent of voters and how many tokens have voted \u201cno\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not yet cast your vote, buttons for voting \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have already voted, a button for changing your vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much voting power your vote will have based on your token balance at the beginning of the vote, along with a link to the block that the vote snapshot was taken from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Past votes\n\n\nThe \u201cPast votes\u201d section shows how many past votes there have been as well as cards for each of the past votes. Each card shows the date of the past vote, the number of the vote, a snippet of the issue being voted on, and the outcome of the vote.\n\n\nClicking on the \u201cView vote\u201d button will then show you more detailed information about the vote. See the previous section 3.3.1 for a detailed explanation of the information in the \u201cView vote\u201d panel.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 New vote\n\n\nIf there is an important question you have that you want to poll tokenholders in the organization about, you can click the \u201cNew vote\u201d button to start a new vote. These votes are purely informative and will not directly result in any further action being taken in the organization. After you have filled out the text field in the \u201cNew vote\u201d panel with the question you want to ask, you can click \u201cBegin vote\u201d to complete the action and create a new vote if you have permission.\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Finance\n\n\nThe Finance app is used to manage the financial resources of an organization. You can see the balance of each asset the organization owns, a history of past transfers, and also create new transfers from the Finance app.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Token Balances\n\n\nThe Token Balances section shows you the balance of each token owned by the organization.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Transfers\n\n\nThe Transfers section shows you a history of past transfers that have been made using the Finance app, including information about the date of the transfer, what address the transfer was to or from, a reference with additional context about the transfer, and the amount of the transfer.\n\n\n\n\nThe transfer history can be filtered by token:\n\n\n\n\nOr transfer type:\n\n\n\n\nAnd for each transfer, you can click on the drop down menu to get a link to view the transaction on the blockchain so you can see even more detail about the transfer:\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 New Transfer\n\n\nTo send funds to your organization, you can create a deposit using the Finance app. Click the \"New Transfer\" button, open the \"Deposit\" tab, select the token you want to deposit, enter the amount and an optional reference note, then click the \"Submit deposit\" button.\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new transfer from your organization to another address, you can create a withdrawal using the Finance app. Click the \u201cNew Transfer\u201d button, open the \"Withdrawal\" tab, then enter the address you want to make the transfer to, what token you want to send, and the amount of tokens you want to send. You can optionally add a reference note to provide more context for the transfer. Once you have filled out all of this information you can click the \u201cSubmit transfer\u201d button to complete the action, if you have permission.\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Permissions\n\n\nThe Permissions app is used to view all of the current permissions that have been set in an organization and add or remove permissions as needed. The permissions set by the Permissions app define which entities have what permissions to perform various actions in an organization. For example, any account may have permission to create a vote but only tokenholders in an organization may have permission to cast a vote.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Browse by app\n\n\nThe Permissions app shows a list of every app installed in the organization and the address or token symbol of that app.\n\n\n\n\nEvery app has a list of actions that can be performed on the app, a list of actions that other entities have been given permission to perform on the app, and a list of permissions that the app has been granted.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1.1 Actions available on this app\n\n\n\nThe \u201cActions available on this app\u201d section shows what actions can be performed on the app and which entity manages each action. This entity is called a \u201cmanager\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nA manager has the ability to choose which entities have permission to perform an action and the ability to change the manager of that action. If a manager removes themself as a manager of a permission without re-assigning the manager role to another entity, then management of that action defaults to whichever entity manages the \u201cCreate permissions\u201d action in the ACL app. If the manager of an action is set as \n0xFFfFfFffFFfffFFfFFfFFFFFffFFFffffFfFFFfF\n then no new manager can be set and permissions granted for that action will be locked forever.\n\n\n\n\nIf an action has not been given a manager yet, then it must be initialized. To initialize an action, enter the address of the entity that you want to manage the action, select which entity you want to grant permission to perform the action, then click the \u201cInitialize permission\u201d button to initialize the permission, if you have permission to do so.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1.2 Permissions set on this app\n\n\n\nThe \u201cPermissions set on this app\u201d section shows which entities have permission to perform which actions on the app. If you are the manager of an action then you can revoke permission from any entity that has been granted permission to perform an action.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1.3 Permissions granted to this app\n\n\n\nThe \u201cPermissions granted\u201d or \u201cPermissions granted to this app\u201d section shows which actions the entity has been granted to perform on which app. If you are the manager of an action in this section then you can revoke permission from the entity that has been granted permission to perform the action.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Browse by entity\n\n\nBack on the main Permissions page, you have the ability to get an at-a-glance view of all of the permissions set in an organization in the \u201cBrowse by entity\u201d section. Here, you can quickly see which entities have been granted permission to perform which actions in the organization. Clicking \u201cView details\u201d will take you to the permissions page for that entity.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Add permission\n\n\nTo give permission to an entity to perform an action on an app, click the \u201cAdd permission\u201d button, select which app you want the entity to perform the action on, select which entity you want to grant the permission to, then select the action you want to grant the entity permission to perform.\n\n\n\n\nEach app has different actions that an entity can be granted permission to perform. Granting permission to an entity to perform these actions on these apps will allow them to:\n\n\n\n\nACL\n\n\nCreate permissions: create permissions in any app that uses this ACL instance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVM Script Registry\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd executors: add an executor to the organization\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable and disable executors: enable and disable executors in an organization\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn executor is an interpreter for running scripts in an organization. All of the apps in an organization use the executors in the organization to execute scripts that are part of transactions sent to the app. Each script has an identifier that determines which executor is used for running the script. For example, whenever a vote transaction is sent to the Voting app, the app runs a script, then uses an executor to execute the script in the transaction. You can find more documentation about executors in the \nAragon Developer Portal\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese actions are very sensitive actions that will give the entity with permission to perform these actions almost complete control of your organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel\n\n\nManage apps: install apps, upgrade apps, and change default apps in an organization. The ACL and the EVM Script Registry are default apps in the organization. Whoever has permission to perform this action can also change the default Vault app of the organization (which is the Vault that tokens will be sent to if tokens are sent to an app that is not meant to accept token deposits).\n\n\n\n\nThese actions are very sensitive actions that will give the entity with permission to perform these actions almost complete control of your organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToken Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssign tokens: mint and assign the specified number of tokens to the specified entity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevoke vesting: revoke token vesting from the specified entity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMint tokens: mint tokens and transfer them to the organization\u2019s Vault app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify quorum: modify the Min. Quorum parameter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate new votes: create a new vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify support: modify the Support parameter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMin. Quorum\u201d\n is short for \u201cMinimum Acceptance Quorum. \u201cMin. Quorum\u201d is the number for what percent of the total outstanding supply of token must approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. For example, if the Min. Quorum is set to 20%, then 20% of the outstanding token supply must vote to approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. If a vote does not make quorum, then it will fail, even if more tokens voted to approve the proposal than voted against it. For example, if the Min.

While traditional legal contracts are ultimately enforced by coercion and the ability to physically seize assets in case one party to the contract does not fulfill their obligations, smart contracts are enforced by computers that ensure the contract is executed exactly as it is programmed. This \u201cself-enforcing\u201d property of smart contracts can reduce the risk involved in certain types of contracts.  The smart contract system Aragon is built on is called  aragonOS . This system ensures that only authorized accounts and contracts (what Aragon refers to as \u201centities\u201d) have permission to perform specific actions in an organization. The same way that a legal contract defines what rights and obligations a party to the contract has, the aragonOS smart contracts define what rights and obligations entities have in an Aragon organization.  Each Aragon organization has apps that can be \u201cinstalled\u201d on aragonOS. These apps extend the functionality of the organization and give members new ways of interacting with each other and the organization itself. Some examples of applications that can be added to Aragon organizations are the Token Manager, Voting, Finance, and Permissions apps. Anyone can develop their own app, add it to their own organization, and publish it for others to use as well.   Note  You can find more information about the technical details of how Aragon works, including how to develop your own Aragon app, in the  Aragon Developer Portal .",

An Ethereum provider such as  MetaMask  and a compatible Ethereum wallet such as  Ledger  or  Trezor  if your Ethereum provider either does not have key management (\"wallet\") functionality built-in or you prefer not to use the built-in wallet functionality.    If you are using Aragon on mainnet, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Main Ethereum Network. You will then need to load your wallet with enough ETH to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. ETH can be acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange that lists ETH. As a rough estimate of how much ETH you should start with, multiply 20,000,000 times the  current \u201cstandard\u201d gas price  times 0.000000001 to find out how much ETH you need. For example, at a current standard gas price of 10 gwei, you should start with 0.2 ETH.    If you are using Aragon on testnet, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Rinkeby Test Network. You will then need to load your wallet with test ether for the Ethereum Rinkeby test network. This test ether is used to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. You can try the  Rinkeby faucet  or post your Ethereum Rinkeby testnet address in the  #faucet channel on Aragon Chat  to receive test ether for free.

This post aims to be a resource for anyone who wants to set up any kind of organization using Aragon\u2019s technology, \nwhich released its beta just a few days ago\n. It\u2019s supposed to function as a workshop in which creators find the initial guidance necessary to start experimenting with the possibilities of DAOs, the new kind of digital organizations!\n\n\nThe style of the guidelines that follow is very basic: someone with pretty much no knowledge of cryptocurrencies or Ethereum should get a solid understanding of the mechanics on how to create a DAO on top of Aragon following 3 simple steps.\n\n\n\n\nAragon\u2019s beta version is now live on the Rinkeby Testnet, and here we\u2019ll talk about that version (Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect). For future deploys, we\u2019ll make additional posts.\n\n\n\n\nThe Basics\n\n\nWhat is a DAO?\n\n\nDAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It is an organization built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, a set of smart contracts that allow for organizations to operate following new governance models that will make even Silicon Valley startups seem \ntraditional\n. I wrote more deeply about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations' nature \nhere\n.\n\n\nBenefits of a DAO\n\n\n\n\nCan\u2019t be censored\n\n\nProgrammable governance modules for different organization models\n\n\nTokens\n easily and transparently distributed\n\n\nOperates under a \ndigital jurisdiction\n in our current digital era\n\n\nNo central power can be corrupted\n\n\nEasier to attract talent around the globe to contribute to the organization\u2019s mission\n\n\nVarious entities: people, other orgs, software\u2026\n\n\nTransparent transactions\n\n\n... many more!\n\n\n\n\nWhat does Aragon do?\n\n\nAragon does many useful things! First and foremost, Aragon \nprovides simple software for the setup of any organization\n. Within a few clicks and very little cost, you can start running a digital organization. Sounds good huh? It also provides a digital jurisdiction for governance and dispute resolution: \nthe Aragon Network\n.\n\n\nTo understand Aragon\u2019s mission in the crypto & DAO space, you can check a little post I made about it, or watch an awesome video released by the team!\n\n\nThe Aragon Mission\n\n\n\n\nEmpowering unstoppable organizations through freedom of collaboration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nSo, you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re creating an organization in 21st century fashion? Awesome! Let\u2019s dive into the \n3 simple steps\n you have to follow to get started using the software that will facilitate the organization\u2019s operations from now on.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf7c Step 1: basic Ethereum tools\n\n\nWe\u2019ll take for granted you know a little bit about what a blockchain is and what Ethereum does (if not, there\u2019s plenty of information online for you to dive into). Yet, some tools and terms might seem confusing, so we\u2019ll outline some very easy to follow definitions about key tools that you must know to set up a DAO.\n\n\nEther\n: Ethereum\u2019s currency/token. The fees to set up the organization, vote, etc. will be paid in ether.\n\n\n(Rinkeby) Testnet\n: Ethereum network built for testing purposes where the ether transacted is virtual; \ndoesn\u2019t hold real value\n. Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect is deployed on this testnet. To get faucet funds for the Rinkeby Testnet, \nfollow this link\n.\n\n\nMetaMask\n is a browser extension that allows you to interact with Ethereum Dapps (like Aragon) directly from Chrome, Firefox or Brave. More info and installation help can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nEtherscan\n allows you to explore and search the Ethereum blockchain for transactions, addresses, tokens, prices and other activities taking place on Ethereum. Aragon 0.5 will point us to Etherscan when we want to check transaction history of the apps, and some other activities we\u2019ll see now.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc23 Step 2: create the DAO\n\n\nReady to create your DAO? Visit \naragon.one\n and click on the blue button on the top right corner that says \u201cTry Aragon Core 0.5\u201d. That will open up a very intuitive initial menu where you must provide the basic infrastructure of your organization.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you will have to choose between using Democracy or Multisig for your Token project. Multisig is still very early in the making and has pretty much no utility at the moment, so we\u2019ll move forward with Democracy.\n\n\n\n\nSecond, you must claim a domain name in _____.\naragonid.eth\n fashion. We chose workshop.aragonid.eth, as shown below, and clicked Next.\n\n\n\n\nThird, we must choose 3 metrics for our Democracy project. They are Support (%), Minimum Quorum (%) and Vote Duration (time). Support is the % of votes an outcome must get to be a winning outcome (in this case, we chose a simple 50% majority). Min.Quorum is the minimum % of token holders that must participate for the vote to be accepted, for which we chose 23% as an example (Min.Quorum can be a bit confusing specially for small organizations: we\u2019ll take a deeper look later when working with the Voting app). Vote Duration represents the time a vote is open; we chose 72 hours.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have to choose the name and symbol for our DAO\u2019s token. We wrote AWK as the ticker.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we must sign two transactions (Token Creation and Organization Creation) with our MetaMask wallet. Testnet price to set up the DAO was ~$50 at the time of the experiment, which depends mostly on the Ethereum Network fees. Remember, it\u2019s virtual ether for now!\n\n\n\n\nClicking twice on Submit (green button) should finish the process, and you should get a message like the one below. Congratulations! Your DAO is ready. Let\u2019s click on Get Started!\n\n\n\n\nWhen we click on the blue Get Started button, we are entering our Aragon DAO for the first time. Exciting! The homepage should present us with four functions regarding the 3 apps available. We\u2019ll now take a deeper look into each one of those.\n\n\n\n\nP.S. This is the creation process for a DAO on Aragon. To enter the DAO afterwards, we must simply open it after clicking \u201cTry Aragon Core 0.5\u201d on \naragon.one\n by entering its name and clicking on \u201cOpen organization\u201d, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcce Step 3: use the apps you need\n\n\nNow that we\u2019ve set up our DAO, we can use the three apps available (for now). They are Token Manager, Voting and Finance, and we\u2019ll also look at the DAO\u2019s settings. They all can be accessed by clicking on the menu at the left of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcca Token Manager\n\n\nThe Token Manager lets you distribute your organization\u2019s tokens amongst stakeholders. At first, the MetaMask wallet address you used for the creation of the DAO will own 100% of the tokens.\n\n\n\n\nTo assign tokens to other DAO members, click on the blue button at the top right corner that says \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d. There, you must provide a valid Ethereum Address for the Recipient of the tokens, and the number of tokens you want to mint. We have chosen to mint 0.1 tokens for the address below.\n\n\n\n\nThis action will inherently open a vote about the decision to mint the tokens, with your vote in favor. Since you\u2019ll be the only token holder at the moment, the vote will automatically close with a Yes. You\u2019ll have to sign the transaction using MetaMask.\n\n\n\n\nAfter assigning tokens to a couple of addresses, your Token Manager should look somewhat like this (check total token distribution at the right of the screen):\n\n\n\n\nFor a more technical description of the Token Manager, see \nhere\n.\n\n\n\u270b Voting\n\n\nThe Voting app is an entity that will execute a set of actions on other entities if token holders of the DAO decide to do so. To open up a new vote, click on the top right corner \u201cNew Vote\u201d button. Then, we must simply state what the vote is for, and click on Begin Vote. You\u2019ll have to confirm the transaction through MetaMask (it\u2019ll open itself automatically).\n\n\n\n\nTo see the details of a certain vote, you can click on View Vote at the right of the screen. It should open up a dashboard like the one below. Remember that you have to be a token holder to be able to participate in a vote in a certain DAO.\n\n\n\n\nThere, we have the Status of the vote, the Quorum (this is set when setting up the DAO), the Question, its creator, and the current results.\n\n\nIn the Workshop\u2019s case, I am holder of 76% of the DAO\u2019s tokens, so as soon as I voted on something (you automatically vote Yes when creating a vote) the vote was closed (as seen in the screenshot). This was confusing at first, but makes sense mathematically; Quorum and Support were met as soon as I voted! I would recommend to keep this in mind when allocating tokens for testing purposes with your fellow creators or partners, otherwise you won\u2019t be able to really try out Voting.\n\n\nFor a more technical description of the Voting app, see \nhere\n.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Finance\n\n\nThe purpose of the Finance app is keeping track of income and expenses in your organization, as well as performing payments. At first, your finances will look somewhat empty, as the DAO holds no funds of her own yet.\n\n\n\n\nYou can use your MetaMask wallet to send some funds to the DAO, or use some other Rinkeby options available for fund transfer. The address to use will be specified later, in the Settings section. In our case, we sent 0.9 to the DAO, which show up in the panel after the transaction takes place in the Ethereum network (you must wait a bit).\n\n\n\n\nNow that the DAO owns funds, you can perform payments by clicking on the \u201cNew Transfer\u201d button on the top right corner. Then, you must choose the Recipient\u2019s address, the amount of tokens and the token (ETH, ANT\u2026) in which you want to send the payment, and add a Reference (short phrase) to identify it. It will be sent by clicking on Submit Transfer.\n\n\n\n\nFor a more technical description of the Finance app, see \nhere\n.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd29 Settings\n\n\nYou can find the Organization\u2019s and the Apps\u2019 addresses in the Settings tab. You should not send funds to the DAO by transacting with the Organization\u2019s address! I made this mistake and wasted a bit of my time, I guess.\n\n\n\n\nGood warning\nAragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect operates on Rinkeby\u2019s Testnet, so you can request test tokens by clicking that option on your DAO\u2019s settings, as seen above, and that will send some test tokens for the DAO to play with. You can also send tokens directly to the Finance app of the DAO, which has its own address. Either way, the funds will appear on the Finance tab shortly after.\n\n\n\n\nThe Token Manager and the Voting app of your DAO also have their own addresses, and their updates can be checked on Etherscan. Below are the recorded transactions of our Workshop\u2019s Voting app.\n\n\n\n\nTo check out more info about the current and future Aragon apps, \nvisit the wiki\n.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc99 Bonus Step: enjoy the journey!\n\n\nThese are the basic things you need to know to set up and operate a DAO with Aragon\u2019s current software. Now it\u2019s time to have fun! The team is always active in the \ncommunity chat\n, so for any further doubts it\u2019s a good idea to reach @light or @tatu there; they\u2019ll quickly help you solve your problems. Some questions were recurring in the chat and social media, so I thought I\u2019d contribute with an explanatory post summarizing the 3 initial steps for anyone to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.\n\n\nThanks a lot for reading! You may comment below what\u2019s the purpose of your DAO or \ntell me on Twitter @ joselfgaray\n \ud83d\udca1\n\n\nDisclaimer\n: \nPublished in the wiki with the permission of \njoselfgaray",

Create an ERC-20 compatible Ethereum wallet\n\n\nIf you already have an ERC-20 compatible Ethereum wallet, you can skip ahead to Step 2.\n\n\nWe recommend either \nMyCrypto\n or \nMetaMask\n for ease of use. Be sure to copy and store your \u201cseed phrase\u201d or \u201cprivate key\u201d in a safe place to ensure that you do not lose access to your funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Sign up for a GitHub account\n\n\nIf you already have a GitHub account, you can skip ahead to Step 3.\n\n\nVisit \nhttps://github.com\n and click the \u201cSign up\u201d button to create a new account.\n\n\n\n\nVisit the \u201cSecurity\u201d page in your account \u201cSettings\u201d and turn on \u201cTwo Factor Authentication\u201d.\n\n\nThis will help prevent your account from getting compromised by hackers.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Log in to Status Open Bounty with your GitHub account\n\n\nIf you are already logged in to Status Open Bounty, you can skip ahead to Step 4.\n\n\nVisit \nhttps://openbounty.status.im\n and click the \u201cLog In\u201d button.\n\n\n\n\nClick the \u201cAuthorize status-open-bounty\u201d button.\n\n\nThis will connect your GitHub account to Status Open Bounty, enabling easy bounty payouts.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Add your Ethereum address to your Status Open Bounty profile\n\n\nIf you have already added your Ethereum address to your Status Open Bounty profile, you can skip ahead to Step 5.\n\n\nClick \u201cMy payment details\u201d in the top menu and copy+paste the address of your ERC-20 compatible Ethereum wallet into the text field.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also click the box to \u201cDisguise myself from the top hunters and activity lists\u201d if you do not want your GitHub profile to show up on the public Status Open Bounty website.\n\n\nClick the \u201cUpdate\u201d button to save your settings.\n\n\nStep 5. Filter search results to show only Aragon bounties\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessary but will make it easier to look through all of the open Aragon bounties.\n\n\nOn the \u201cBounties\u201d page, click the \u201cOwner\u201d search filter and select the \u201cAragon\u201d box.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Click on a bounty you are interested in and review the details of the bounty\n\n\nThis bounty is in the \u201caragon-monthly\u201d repo of the Aragon GitHub organization. It has a bounty of 5 ANT for submitting a news link to the Aragon Monthly newspaper.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \u201cCode\u201d tab to find the \u201cREADME.md\u201d file that tells you about the repository that hosts the bounty you are interested in. Also see if there is a \u201cCONTRIBUTING.md\u201d document with specific instructions about how to contribute to the repo.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the instructions for contributing are located in the README.md file of the aragon-monthly repo. In other repos, the instructions may be located in a CONTRIBUTING.md file.\n\n\n\n\nStep 7. Submit a pull request to the repo hosting the bounty with a correct solution to the issue\n\n\nYou can either use the GitHub Web UI, a Desktop Git UI, or a Command Line Interface text editor to submit your Pull Request. If you have never used Git or GitHub before, there is a helpful \u201cGit for beginners\u201d guide \nhere\n and a more in-depth guide \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf your Pull Request is accepted and merged, then the Status Open Bounty app will pay out the advertised bounty to the address that you added to your profile in Step 4.\n\n\nCongratulations! You\u2019ve just earned your first Aragon bounty.",

We are preparing for this by giving the teams their own voice here in the Aragon Project blog.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Monthly Issue 09 is out!\n\n\nThe latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, decentralized governance and the Aragon ecosystem\n\n\n\n\nAragon Monthly was introduced a while back in my post Bringing DAOs back\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon Monthly and has since been a monthly aggregated source of News and Articles for people interested in decentralized organizations and governance.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q3 2018 Transparency Report\n\n\nA recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q3 2018.\n\n\n\n\nAs per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q3 Development Update\n\n\nProgress of development from the third quarter of 2018.\n\n\n\n\nA number of major milestones were reached in the months of July to September, 2018. Culminating in our decision to buckle down and launch the first Mainnet release of Aragon at Devcon IV.\n\n\n\n\nFinal details about the ANT vote on AGP-1\n\n\nDecentralizing Aragon community governance\n\n\n\n\nOn October 16th we announced the opening of the public review and comment period for the draft of AGP-1, the newly proposed Aragon Governance Proposal process. This review period ended last Friday, November 9th, and was followed by a final review and vote by the Aragon Association Board of Directors.\n\n\nI am pleased to announce that the Aragon Association board has voted unanimously to approve AGP-1 for an Aragon Network Token vote.\n\n\n\n\nAragon @ DevCon4 Recap\n\n\nCENTRALIZATION IS STRENGTH\n\n\n\n\nEvery DevCon is special. But this one was especially special to Aragon. We had most of the team in Prague for the occasion, several of whom also attended the wonderfully organized #CryptoLife hackathon and the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians Council of Prague in the days preceding the annual Ethereum family reunion. At this year\u2019s DevCon, we were out to share the good news: Aragon is bringing DAOs back, mainnet style.\n\n\n\n\nOctober\n\n\nAragon 0.6 is live on Mainnet\n\n\nDecentralized organizations just got real.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Aragon 0.6, named Alba, you can now create Aragon organizations on the Ethereum Mainnet. This is a new era for human collaboration. New kinds of organizations that we haven't even dreamed of before can be now created.\n\n\n\n\nFlock, funding for Aragon teams\n\n\nThe next step in decentralizing Aragon's development.\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year we set the path for decentralizing Aragon's development.\n\n\nAnd, after half a year, our vision is already a reality. There are two teams working on Aragon's development already: Aragon One and Aragon DAC.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Nest: Third round of grants\n\n\nFive new teams have been awarded grants with funding from the Aragon Project.\n\n\n\n\nThe Nest grants program has introduced rounds one and two with the first teams. We now have five more teams that have been granted funding by the Aragon Project.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does governance mean\n\n\nAn intro to the principles of governance.\n\n\n\n\nEvery collective action whether it is a small group or a vast nation-state follows a governance process. Sometimes this process is formalized, well-documented, and rigid. Other times it is so fluid and informal that it is difficult to observe. The purpose of this post is not to prescribe or analyze any specific process or method for governing, as governance is contextual.\n\n\nInstead, I want to describe a framework for thinking about the power dynamics associated with a governance process, and explore why its important to decentralize governance by establishing processes which prevent or mitigate the ability for power to concentrate and subvert the process at the expense of the organization as a whole.\n\n\n\n\nDeprecation notice for v0.5 Rinkeby DAOs\n\n\nExisting test organizations deployed on Rinkeby to be deprecated after Oct. 28th.\n\n\n\n\nSince the launch of Aragon Core v0.5 on the Rinkeby testnet this March, the Aragon One development team has been continually improving and battle testing the smart contracts that form the bedrock of over 2500 test organizations. However, as we progress toward a Mainnet launch, it's time to start bringing the latest technology to decentralized organizations.\n\n\nTo do this, on October 29, 2018, we will upgrade Aragon Core to version 0.6 on Rinkeby. This new version will include contracts that are not backwards-compatible with the existing v0.5 organizations. As part of the upgrade, we will also be deploying a new ENS registry that will reset the organization names available on aragonid.eth.\n\n\nAs a result, any existing test organizations deployed on Rinkeby will be deprecated on Oct. 29, 2018.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Nest Update\u2014Evolution of the grants program\n\n\nThe Nest program has been up and running for 7 months already. It's mature enough to make a high level analysis of the program so far and talk a bit about its future.\n\n\n\n\nNest is the grants program run by the Aragon Association (formerly the Aragon Foundation). The process is public and transparent. The Aragon One team was the only team managing it and deciding who and what gets funded up until now. Currently, the Aragon DAC, the new Aragon team, is also participating in the application process. The idea is that all the different Aragon teams will have a part to play in this grants program.\n\n\n\n\nNest Team Interviews: Prysmatic Labs\n\n\nThe third of our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is with Prysmatic Labs who are building an Ethereum sharding client.\n\n\n\n\nWith this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing AraCon \u2014 The Aragon Conference\n\n\nToday we\u2019re announcing the first Aragon Conference \u2014 AraCon.\n\n\n\n\nAraCon is the culmination of all the people supporting this and we couldn\u2019t be happier to be inviting everyone to join us at this event.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\n\n\nAragon Community Update #1\n\n\nWelcome to the first Aragon community update!\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve had a lot going on in the foreground and background of the community since I first joined as Community Lead last year and I\u2019m excited to share some of what we\u2019ve been up to.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Monthly Issue 08 is out!\n\n\nThe latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, decentralized governance and the Aragon ecosystem\n\n\n\n\nAragon Monthly was introduced a while back in my post Bringing DAOs back\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon Monthly and has since been a monthly aggregated source of News and Articles for people interested in decentralized organizations and governance.\n\n\n\n\nNest Team Interviews: Pando\n\n\nThe second of our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is with Pando who are also working on an open source incentivization app.\n\n\n\n\nWith this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program. Pando, when complete, will be a big step towards decentralization of development for all.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a decentralized OS\n\n\nHow we built an Ethereum operating system that is upgradeable, secure and easy to use\n\n\n\n\nThe general concept goes as follows: You wouldn't want a Tetris app to own full control over your RAM. That would enable tampering with other apps or stealing precious information.\n\n\nSimilarly, you wouldn't want a CryptoKitties app to have full control over the funds of your DAO.\n\n\nThe role of the OS is to impose a rule system to not let that happen.\n\n\n\n\nNest Team Interviews: That Planning Suite\n\n\nThe first one on our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is That Planning Suite who are working on an open source incentivization app.\n\n\n\n\nWith this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program. That Planning Suite was the first team accepted into the program and we're all thrilled to see their suite of apps becoming a part of the Aragon ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\nAragon at ETHBerlin\n\n\nHey, hey, heeey! This is Aragon and we are coming to ETHBerlin, Berlin!\n\n\n\n\nWe are so excited, so happy, really so thrilled to be Tier 5 \u2013 The Carlos Matos sponsor of the hackathon. Our mentors are coming, and they are coming in waves! Let me tell you, that we started 92 days ago with only one goal in mind. And right now, we are reaching that goal of being a part of the astonishing and inspiring ETHBerlin hackathon. And let me tell you that we are now actually putting two distinct bounty tracks up for hackers to #buidl on during the hackathon!\n\n\n\n\nAugust\n\n\nAragon Labs Research Update #1\n\n\nLatest news from the Aragon Research & Development department, Labs\n\n\n\n\nOur research efforts are on exploring how to realize the lofty ambition of becoming a decentralized, digital jurisdiction. Both the scope and range of services a jurisdiction could offer to attract its constituency are vast and worth exploring. The single most crucial consideration right now is how it will be governed. With effective governance processes we can create new tools for the community. Tools to create new services, or replace or alter existing services, as required to make organizations more effective.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Monthly Issue 07 is out!\n\n\nThe latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, decentralized governance and the Aragon ecosystem\n\n\n\n\nAragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem. Created by the community, for the community.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q2 2018 Transparency Report\n\n\nA recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q2 2018\n\n\n\n\nAs per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Nest: Updates from the teams #1\n\n\nBecause accountability is key on funding new teams to work on decentralized ecosystems\n\n\n\n\nOne of the future plans for Nest is to start involving the community further so that it can participate in the decision making process regarding Nest's yearly budget and its governance... With those plans in mind we want to share with the community the progress of the first batch of the teams funded. The challenges they have faced, and the milestones they have accomplished. We plan to have the teams do these public updates every quarter. One of the key differentiators of the Nest program has always been transparency.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Nest: Second round of grants\n\n\nFour new teams have been awarded grants with funding from the Aragon Project\n\n\n\n\nEarlier the Nest grants program introduced the five first teams that had been awarded grants and told what they are working on. On this second update we announce the four new teams that have been granted funding by the Aragon Project.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q2 Development Update\n\n\nProgress of development from the second quarter of 2018 and first round of audit results\n\n\n\n\nOur developers have hard at work and here's a recap of the progress of development from the second quarter of 2018. Earlier we told that first round of audits was underway and today we are also publishing the results of that audit!\n\n\n\n\nAragon DAC, a new community effort to foster Aragon's development led by Giveth\n\n\nThe Aragon Foundation and Giveth are proud to announce the launch of Aragon DAC, a Decentralized Altruistic Community on the Giveth platform that will work on building out core Aragon infrastructure from the end user's perspective\n\n\n\n\nYou might know by now that Aragon is decentralizing its development: the first step was the introduction of Aragon One, the next step was announcing the onboarding of more teams to work on core infrastructure, in the near future. Well, the future is today!\n\n\n\n\nAragon against censorship\u2014Goodbye Medium, hello Ghost\n\n\nAragon is taking action against censorship by moving away from Medium\n\n\n\n\nOn the journey that we are on, making Web3.0, the decentralized web, a reality, there will be obstacles we need to overcome. Hurdles set by those clinging on to their power by any means necessary, even going as far as putting on blanket bans on all crypto projects. This effectively is censoring content by those trying to make the world a more free and open place to live.\n\n\n\n\nJuly\n\n\nDeploying and distributing Aragon Core\n\n\nHow to deploy and distribute a censorship-resistant upgradeable dApp\n\n\n\n\nFrom the inception of the first versions of Aragon Core we took building a truly decentralized app very seriously. We decided that just using Ethereum as the settlement layer was not enough, because if a significant part of the infrastructure depended on centralized servers, we would quickly become a central point of failure that could be taken down.\n\n\n\n\nManifesto-based organizations\n\n\nHow to fix soulless corporations from making everyone miserable\n\n\n\n\nIn the ideal world, every organization has a manifesto with its mission and values. Those values could be ranked, just like in the Aragon Manifesto.\n\n\nIf an organization fails to follow their manifesto, users can point out the value they broke.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Monthly Issue 06 is out!\n\n\nThe latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem\n\n\n\n\nAragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem. Created by the community, for the community.\n\n\n\n\nOn Signaling and Social Pressure\n\n\nHow the Ethereum community could begin making meaningful signaling-based decisions\n\n\n\n\nWith the recent \nMainnet release of our Survey app\n, I would like to propose the idea of Signaling DAOs as a way for stakeholder groups to self organize and produce clear signals. A Signaling DAO could be created by anyone, but in order for it to be impactful it should attempt to be representative of a relevant stakeholder group.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Aggregation Theory \ud83d\udc08\n\n\nExploring how the valuation models fail to account for protocol commoditization\n\n\n\n\nThis post explores how the valuation models used to evaluate decentralized service protocols leveraging \u201cwork\u201d tokens fail to account for protocol commoditization.\n\n\n\n\nJune\n\n\nAragon Core v0.5.1 Post Mortem\u200a\u2014\u200aPart 1\n\n\nSummary of our first new development cycle\n\n\n\n\nOur initial goal is to establish three two-week sprints. These sprints define a six week cycle. We established this goal as a starting point for the new product development process. The goal emerged from a discussion at our last offsite meeting in Switzerland. 0.5.1 started immediately after the offsite, on 16 April 2018.\n\n\n\n\nOpening applications for the Building DAOs video series\n\n\nJoin us in building your own customized DAO on Ethereum\n\n\n\n\nWith the recent launch of Aragon Core v0.5 we have seen a lot of renewed interest from people wanting to use Aragon to build their own decentralized organizations, or DAOs for short. To help kick off the process, we are excited to invite our community to participate in Building DAOs, an educational video series that will feature the Aragon One developer team working side-by-side with community members and their teams to configure their smart contracts and build their DAOs.\n\n\n\n\nMay\n\n\nAragon launches Survey app on Mainnet\n\n\nFirst Aragon app launched on Ethereum Mainnet for community sentiment signaling\n\n\n\n\nToday we are releasing an entirely new step for community members to signal their sentiment on the project and igniting the next level of participation in the project for all ANT holders.\n\n\nSurvey app is the fourth app developed by our team in addition to the Token Manager, Voting & Finance apps seen previously in Aragon Core v0.5. And the first one to launch on the Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network\u200a\u2014\u200aOn a path towards a digital jurisdiction\n\n\nLaunch of a new edition of the Aragon Network whitepaper and our research forum\n\n\n\n\nAs we have continued on our journey thinking about the challenges of creating a jurisdiction designed to be inclusive of DAOs and other pseudoanynomous entities, the economics and mechanisms in the original whitepaper have continued to evolve. Thus far, this progression has mostly been loose thoughts scattered among various chats and in-person conversations. But as development of the underlying infrastructure to support the network is maturing, the need for formalizing how the Aragon Network will operate grows.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q1 Transparency Report\n\n\nA recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q1 2018\n\n\n\n\nAs per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project.\n\n\n\n\nReleasing the Aragon Developer Portal\n\n\nA new command line tool for building Aragon apps, a straightforward tutorial, and reference documentation for all the building blocks\n\n\n\n\nToday, we introduce tools and documentation for:\n\n\n\n\naragonOS, the smart contract framework that provides upgradeability and governance solutions out-of-the-box\n\n\naragonUI, for a beautiful frontend experience\n\n\naragon.js, in the middle connecting the two together\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecentralizing Aragon\u2019s development III: Onboarding new teams\n\n\nIncentivizing new teams to work on common Aragon infrastructure\n\n\n\n\nWe have already explained why we are decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development, how we are decentralizing the legal vehicle that represents the project and introduced Aragon One, the first company contributing to Aragon\u2019s development. In this post, we will lay out the strategy for onboarding more teams to work on core Aragon infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Aragon One\n\n\nThe first company contributing to Aragon\u2019s development\n\n\n\n\nSince we released the first version of the Aragon whitepaper, we knew that it was important to split the non-profit entity overseeing the project from the actual companies or teams working on its development.\n\n\nToday, we are announcing the next step. We are announcing Aragon One.\n\n\n\n\nFirst community-wide Aragon Feedback Survey!\n\n\nTell us what you think of Aragon and how we can improve the project in the future\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have released Aragon Core v0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s time to hear your thoughts on how has your experience with it been and how can we improve it in the future. This survey is about the Aragon project in general, so you can take part even if you haven\u2019t used the app yet!\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q1 Development Update\n\n\nProgress of development from the first quarter of 2018\n\n\n\n\nReleasing Aragon Core v0.5, The Architect, was the biggest development milestone during the first quarter of the year.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Nest: First awarded grants\n\n\nFive teams already funded and building is underway\n\n\n\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to introduce the first five projects that we\u2019ve granted funding in order for them to flourish, thrive and to pursue their goals of advancing these ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Manifesto\n\n\nA pledge to fight for freedom\n\n\n\n\nWe believe humankind should use technology as a liberating tool to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another.\n\n\nThus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies.\n\n\n\n\nDecentralizing Aragon\u2019s development II: Minimum Viable Foundation\n\n\nReducing the Aragon Foundation to its minimum in order to decentralize the governance and development of the project\n\n\n\n\nWe have previously shared our plans to transform the Aragon project to a community governed project. As described in the decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development post, reducing the Foundation to its minimum is a key step in reaching that goal and decoupling the project from the foundational team working on it, and to level the playground for other teams to jump into the core development of the project.\n\n\n\n\nApril\n\n\nAragon + Zug = \u2764\n\n\nAragon\u2019s legal entity and operations are moving to Zug, Switzerland\n\n\n\n\nWe first met with the government of Zug a year ago, thanks to Ethereum\u2019s cofounder and Aragon\u2019s advisor Mihai Alisie. Mihai set up Ethereum Foundation\u2019s operations in Zug back in the day, and he was one of the early proponents of the Crypto Valley\u200a\u2014\u200aa vibrant crypto ecosystem across Switzerland and Lichtenstein\u200a\u2014\u200awith Zug at its epicenter.\n\n\nBut Zug is a very special place for multiple reasons. Let\u2019s explore them.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Team Update: March 2018\n\n\nWritten reviews of what the team members have been up to\n\n\n\n\nTeam members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\n\n\nMarch\n\n\nAragon Core v0.5\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201dThe Architect\u201d release\n\n\nThe most powerful Aragon release to date\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re extremely excited to be announcing the next major milestone of the Aragon project along with our brand new video!\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Chris, Aragon\u2019s Product Manager\n\n\nChris is joining the team to enhance the product development process even further\n\n\n\n\nLatest interviewee in our Team Interviews is Chris, Aragon\u2019s new Product Manager! We dive into his thoughts of how Ethereum and Aragon can help change the world for the better, what steps we can take to make creating Aragon an even better process and his philosophy on life.\n\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\nAragon Team Update: February 2018\n\n\nWritten reviews of what the team members have been up to\n\n\n\n\nTeam members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine).

ETHDenver is an Ethereum community event featuring a hackathon and workshops.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Jouni, Aragon\u2019s Design Lead\n\n\nJouni is an experienced designer who\u2019s looking to change the future of society and work\n\n\n\n\nThis time on Team Interviews Jouni, Aragon\u2019s new Design Lead! We get into his previous work designing open source software, what kind of impact technology can have on our global living environment and how he sees Ethereum and the blockchain technology potentially shaping the future of society and work.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Bingen, Aragon\u2019s Solidity Engineer\n\n\nBingen is a developer and an open source advocate joining Aragon to make the world a better place\n\n\n\n\nToday our Team Interview is with Bingen, Aragon\u2019s new Solidity Engineer\u200a\u2014\u200awe talked about his interest to make the world a better place through Aragon, and what are his thoughts on Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\nAragon at ETHDenver\n\n\nAragon is a proud sponsor, mentor, and bounty provider at the ETHDenver hackathon\n\n\n\n\nFor all of February 16\u201318, 2018 you can find several of Aragon team members at the ETHDenver hackathon. We\u2019re proud to be sponsoring this exciting event and are very much looking forward to seeing what people come up with there.\n\n\n\n\nDecentralizing Aragon\u2019s development\n\n\nSplitting the Foundation from the core devs, and kickstarting funding for other teams to work on Aragon\n\n\n\n\nFor the project to be as resilient as possible, the development of the project should not be controlled by a single central entity. It should be in the hands of the community and multiple different development teams.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing Aragon Labs\n\n\nWhere research meets development\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of Aragon Labs is to enable experimental research and development efforts that move fast and some times break (minor) things. Running these experiments allows us to learn from these experiences. And we can re-iterate and run these experiments for as long as we need. Until we are confident that our tools and products have become stable and mature. That their development has reached a point that signifies them ready to secure valuable ecosystems such as the Aragon Network itself.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Team Update: January 2018\n\n\nWritten reviews of what the team members have been up to\n\n\n\n\nTeam members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine).

This release paves the way for Aragon to be an extendable governance tool which supports all possible use cases. It has required an immense amount of changes, including a re-architecturing called \naragonOS\n\n\n\n\nAragon Chat is now open\n\n\nAragon starts using the open source messaging platform Rocket Chat\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re happy to inform you that the migration to Rocket Chat is now complete.\nAll users and public channels have been migrated over to the new platform, so feel free to jump in and join the conversation!\nTo use the new Aragon Chat, you can connect directly via the web page or download one of the clients available for Rocket Chat and point it to https://aragon.chat\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing aragonOS: Say hi to modular and extendable organizations\n\n\nAragon\u2019s new exokernel-inspired architecture\n\n\n\n\naragonOS\n smart contract architecture is based on the idea of an organization being the aggregate of multiple components (called \napplications\n) and a pillar that is the \nKernel\n, which governs how these applications can talk to each other and how other entities can interact with them.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\n\n\nAragon will be Community Governed\n\n\nWhat community governance really entails\n\n\n\n\nSince the inception of the project, Aragon\u2019s vision has been to be open source software and to give power over it to the people who use it. The whole platform will be a community effort\u200a\u2014\u200aand it will take time to build it as envisioned.\n\n\nRight now we are a community based project and our long-term plan is to be a community governed project. To learn why this has been our vision for the project, where we are at the moment and how we plan on achieving our goals, let\u2019s take a look into the history and definition of these terms\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing Our Migration To An Open Source Messaging Platform\n\n\nAragon will migrate to Rocket Chat along with 10 other Ethereum projects\n\n\n\n\nToday we are announcing the plan of several Ethereum based projects to migrate to the open source messaging platform Rocket Chat.\n\n\nAragon will be migrating our community out of Slack and onto Rocket Chat in the next couple of weeks.\n\n\nThis has been a joint effort from the projects participating in the migration plan. Aragon initially started the proposal for the community after there had already been discussion on the subject from multiple projects. We came together as members of the same ecosystem and community to work on this plan to find an alternative that fit the needs of these cryptocurrency projects.\n\n\n\n\nAugust\n\n\nWhy Transparency Matters\n\n\nAragon Transparency Model and the unveiling of Aragon\u2019s new Transparency Framework\n\n\n\n\nAt Aragon, we feel obliged to show to our community\u200a\u2014\u200asupporters, contributors and token holders\u200a\u2014\u200athat we are being productive, effective and using the raised funds in a responsible manner.\n\n\nThe community is very important to us, they are the ones that we\u2019re building this project for. They support us, provide feedback and ideas on how we can all move forward while catering the needs of the users. In turn, we want to uphold our high transparency standards to keep the community up to date on what we are doing.\n\n\nThis is why we\u2019re showcasing our model for doing things transparently.\n\n\nThis all began with our Pre-Sale Transparency Report. And recently continued with the Token Buyback Transparency Report.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll now present you with all the different methods we\u2019re employing. The parts of our project\u2019s transparency model, starting with the new Transparency Framework.\n\n\n\n\nToken Buyback Transparency Report\n\n\nWhy did we buy back ANT and how we will disclose these events\n\n\n\n\nToday, adhering to our high transparency standards, we\u2019re ready to take the first step in our plan to extend our level of transparency\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is why we\u2019re reporting our token buybacks.\n\n\nIn our Intended Use of Revenue post we outlined the broad estimated allocation of our funds. As the development of our project has continued, we\u2019ve been able to narrow down some of the use cases of which we\u2019ll use our funds for.\n\n\n\n\nJuly\n\n\nAragon Network Jurisdiction Part 1: Decentralized Court\n\n\n\n\nWhen first designing Aragon, the goal was to have organizations run entirely trustless. Thus, we created a platform to create organizations governed by trustless and immutable code. Now, when we say that these organizations run in a trustless manner, we\u2019re talking about how to describe the laws under which the code runs. Code is trustless when deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It won\u2019t change at the whim of a person, it will run as designed, following the logic set forth in it.\n\n\nYet, it was clear that we can\u2019t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn\u2019t aware about the physical world. And often, in the case of disputes, things are subjective and up to interpretation.\n\n\nOur solution to this problem is the Aragon Network Jurisdiction. A decentralized jurisdiction to solve subjective disputes as an Aragon Network service.\n\n\n\n\nThe emergent Ethereum stack\n\n\ndistrict0x, the first manifestation of the Ethereum + Aragon stack\n\n\n\n\nSoftware allows us to abstract away from existing functionality to focus on building.\n\n\nAt Aragon, we use Ethereum. Ethereum provides us the consensus layer to establish truth. And the ability to create smart contracts that are self-enforcing.\n\n\nSo, generally speaking, we don\u2019t have to worry about Ethereum. We use Ethereum, driving usage to the platform, thus increasing its value. So we\u2019re indirectly funding its further development.\n\n\nThat\u2019s the virtuous circle that tokenization makes possible.\n\n\n\n\nAragon\u2019s Community Governance Model\n\n\nHow we plan to achieve transparency and inclusion for the community\n\n\n\n\nOur community is everything for us. With Aragon, we want a thousand communities to flourish. Tokens align the incentives of communities and projects towards the same goals and values. But those communities are the center of where the magic happens.\n\n\nTwo weeks ago we posted our Community Governance Model for feedback from the community. We received some comments on it, and we now have the final version of the model ready. Before this, we had already worked on the model internally. I drafted the original version and Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo provided their thoughts on it.\n\n\nFurther changes might be made as things develop. But we wanted to show the community what we\u2019ll be doing in terms of governance, transparency and inclusion.\n\n\nThe model was designed so that every community member will be treated equally. Everyone will have the same changes of participation, and our Meetings and decisions to be transparent.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Mihai Alisie as an Advisor\n\n\nWhy him, why now and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nWe announced two of our Advisors before the successful ANT sale. Kenny Rowe from the MakerDAO project and Jake Brukhman of CoinFund. Both experts in their fields and respected members of the Ethereum community.\n\n\nWhile we did have our Board of Advisors in place before the token sale, we chose not to disclose all the members then.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q2 Development Update\n\n\nv0.4 release status and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nWe will be delivering regular updates on the development of Aragon. This is our first quarterly update to bring the community up to speed on where we\u2019re at and the road ahead.\n\n\n\n\nJune\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Mar\u00eda, Aragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations\n\n\nMar\u00eda shares her thoughts about Aragon and what got her into working on an Ethereum based project\n\n\n\n\nAs a continuation on our team interview series, I interviewed Mar\u00eda\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about her, her interest in Ethereum, how she came to work, and her role, at Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nAragon to power the district0x Network\n\n\nWelcoming district0x to the Aragon Network Jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\nToday, we are pleased to introduce the first resident of the Aragon Network Jurisdiction, the district0x Network\n\n\nThe district0x Network is a collective of decentralized marketplaces and communities powered by Ethereum, Aragon, and IPFS. Markets on the network, also referred to as districts, are all built upon a shared framework comprised of smart contracts and front-end libraries which provide the functionality necessary to operate communal marketplaces which are similar to services like AirBNB, eBay, Uber, or Reddit with payments.\n\n\n\n\nAragon partners with 0x\n\n\nMaking decentralized organizations go beyond Ether\n\n\n\n\nSo today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019re partnering with 0x to allow Aragon organizations to accept and operate with any token. 0x is a protocol for decentralized exchange on Ethereum allowing users to exchange tokens without a central broker\u200a\u2014\u200aending the many inefficiencies of centralization by enabling transparent token exchanges between contracts.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Tatu, Aragon\u2019s Community Lead\n\n\nTatu talks about why he is part of the Ethereum community and why he is so enthusiastic about Aragon and decentralization\n\n\n\n\nAs part of our team interview series (Luis\u2019 Interview|Jorge\u2019s Interview), I\u2019ve interviewed Tatu\u2014 Aragon\u2019s Community Lead\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about his experience in the Ethereum ecosystem, the projects he\u2019s most excited about, and why he chose to work for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nMay\n\n\nAnnouncing the ENS Aragon Network Company Registry\n\n\n\n\nWith Aragon, we set out to create software that makes it easy to create and run decentralized organizations. However, meaningless ETH addresses made sending funds and completing transactions for operating a business unnecessarily complicated.\n\n\nFortunately, ENS (Ethereum Name Service) recently solved this issue by enabling the assignment of human-readable names to eth addresses. This was important for the entire Ethereum ecosystem (including Aragon)\u2014 no longer do you have to send transactions to a series of numbers and letters.\n\n\nSo today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we won the bid for the name company.eth! In this post, we\u2019ll explain how Aragon organizations will use the name and the implications for Aragon Network user-adoption.\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Token Sale: The Numbers\n\n\nRoughly $25 million was collected in 26 minutes. The rate was $122k/s the first 3 blocks.\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, we closed the 4th largest crowdfunding event in history, and the 2nd largest in the blockchain space (after The DAO). Raising 275,000 ether, or roughly $25 million, we\u2019re incredibly humbled by the support of the community and the trust in our mission to make decentralized autonomous organizations widespread.\n\n\nIn this post, we\u2019d like to reflect on the last 48 hours, provide some data on the sale, and most importantly express our gratitude to the community.\n\n\n\n\nFinal token sale recap\n\n\n\n\nPlease read How to Securely Participate in the sale for information and tutorials on how to participate.\n\n\n\n\nPre-Sale Transparency Report\n\n\n\n\nBefore tomorrow\u2019s token sale, we believe it\u2019s important that we release a transparency report about the pre-sale. This post will provide you with details on who purchased ANT before the token sale, the terms of the sale, the total Ether received, and how those funds were used.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Token Sale Contracts Have Been Deployed and Activated\n\n\nANT sale begins on Ethereum mainnet\u2019s block 3,723,000\u200a\u2014\u200aMay 17, ~6pm GMT\n\n\n\n\nHow to Participate in the Sale\n\n\n\n\nWait for block 3,723,000 (May 17 at approximately 6pm GMT). You can check what the latest block is on Etherscan. After block 3,722,999 has been mined, it is safe to send the transaction. Note that sending the transaction before that block is mined will result in a loss of fees.\n\n\nSend ETH to the address posted on https://aragon.network\n\n\nSend at least 200,000 gas with your transaction.\n\n\nIf your contribution is accepted, tokens will be transferred to your address in the same transaction. However, tokens will not be transferable until the sale is finalized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Community Multisig\n\n\nA 3/5 multisig that will approve the deployment of the Aragon Network\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network Token (ANT) will initially begin as an upgradable token, but will evolve to serve as the governance token for the Aragon Network when deployed.\n\n\nWe estimate that the Aragon Network will be deployed in May of 2018. Prior to deployment and transition to a governance token, we plan to perform numerous audits and bug bounties to ensure thorough testing and to mitigate the risk of another DAO hack.\n\n\nHowever, the actual ANT token will be first distributed in 2 days. So this raises the question: how do we plan to upgrade the token\u2019s functionality to a governance token?\n\n\n\n\nToken sale cap clarification\n\n\ntl;dr: Our cap is not $100m, or near that amount\n\n\n\n\nWe have had a lot of questions about our hidden cap mechanism.\n\n\nSince it\u2019s pretty new to the token sale world, we understand the confusion and want to provide a simple breakdown to clarify.\n\n\n\n\nToken Sale Audit Results\n\n\nNo Critical Issues Reported and Token Sale is On-Schedule\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure a stable and safe token sale, we employed the help of Jordi Baylina and Piper Merriam to perform independent audits of Aragon token sale contract code. Jordi and Piper completed their reports this week and published their independent findings (Jordi\u2019s Report | Piper\u2019s Report). No critical issues were reported in either independent audit. And for the issues that were found, we\u2019ve worked closely with Jordi and Piper to resolve them and improve the code.\n\n\nIn addition, we\u2019re happy to announce that there have been no critical issues reported through the bug bounty program. Thanks to all of those that have participated, and note that the bug bounty program will continue indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the Aragon Advisors\n\n\nKenny from MakerDAO and Jake from CoinFund will be advising Aragon\n\n\n\n\nWe are pleased to announce two people that we really admire in the Ethereum community will be joining us as advis0rs: Kenny Rowe and Jake Brukhman.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Sourcing Aragon\n\n\nMaking Aragon Code Accessible and Providing Documentation Soon\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 12, I got my first laptop\u200a\u2014\u200aa piece of junk with only 256MB of RAM. It was slow and literally falling apart. But this didn\u2019t stop me from developing. Using Linux, I had the latest available software. And thanks to thousands of developers around the world, I could examine different pieces of code and learn programming.\n\n\nThe free software and open source phenomena has not only made the world a more inclusive place, but it has also increased the speed of software development\u200a\u2014\u200aby sharing, developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel. For example, we didn\u2019t have to build the native app wrapper or the Ethereum wallet for Aragon.\n\n\nSo when we find something that we can give back to the community, we make a point of doing so. We\u2019ve found that by sharing code, others can learn from it (like I did as a teenager) and people will find ways to improve it.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Securely Participate in the Aragon Token Sale\n\n\nUsing Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask\n\n\n\n\nThe ANT token sale is happening on May 17th! In anticipation, we\u2019ve been and will continue to frequently post about Aragon and sale details. In this post, we list the sources to trust for ANT sale information, and provide instructions for purchasing with Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask.\n\n\n\n\nAragon On Tour: Meetups Around the Globe\n\n\nCome to one of our meetups, have a beer with us and talk decentralized awesomeness\n\n\n\n\nOn the Internet, nobody knows you\u2019re a dog. This has been extremely beneficial for the development of communities around the world, and crypto is perhaps one of the most remarkable examples.\n\n\nBut who doesn\u2019t like to have a beer with people that share common interests? It\u2019s part of our human nature!\n\n\nSo aside from being on Slack all day and night, we\u2019ve organized a series of meetups for Ethereum & Aragon enthusiasts to get together to talk about exciting projects and have a few drinks!\n\n\n\n\nAragon Tutorial: Raising funds with a token\n\n\nHow you can raise capital creating your own token in a few clicks\n\n\n\n\nToken sales are changing the rules of the game, making it extremely easy for anyone in the world to gather capital and build new products.\n\n\nWith Aragon, you can create token sales in a few clicks and publish the sale address so everyone can participate.\n\n\n\n\nOur Public Product Roadmap and Issue Reporting\n\n\nEnhancing transparency in product development\n\n\n\n\nOften, product and software development is secretive and confidential until the official product launch. While this has the effect of building excitement, it can lead to unrealistic user expectations, development of products that are missing key features, and ultimately products that miss end-user needs.\n\n\nAs a result, we believe it\u2019s important to engage the community throughout the product development process\u200a\u2014\u200aand this is what we\u2019ve done while developing Aragon. The community has consistently provided valuable feedback and unique perspectives. From user interface design to our token model, feedback from the Aragon community has guided Aragon Core and Network development.\n\n\n\n\nAragon token sale bug bounty\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce that we are conducting a bug bounty in advance of the Aragon Network Token sale. We believe bug bounties are essential to ensuring a safe release, and are especially important when cryptocurrency is being exchanged. This post will provide more details on our bug bounty program scope, the timeline, and compensation.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Tutorial: Tokens and voting\n\n\nHow you can easily create your own token and govern your organization with it\n\n\n\n\nFrom the beginning, we wanted Aragon to be a tool that anyone can use. So we put a lot of thought into making things easy.\n\n\nTo make things even easier, we are starting a series of short videos that explain every part of Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nOur Intended Use of Revenue\n\n\nHow we plan to use the token sale to drive development\n\n\n\n\nAs previously announced, the Aragon Network Token (ANT) sale will be conducted on May 17th. The funds raised will fund Aragon Core development and the Network deployment.\n\n\nThe specific steps and timeline to make Aragon production ready are outlined in our development plan, released last week. In this post, we\u2019re excited to provide details on our intended use of revenue from the token sale.\n\n\n\n\nApril\n\n\nAragon + Status: Bringing decentralized organizations everywhere\n\n\nGetting ready to offer Aragon to 2.3bn smartphone users\n\n\n\n\nOur mission at Aragon is to make decentralized organizations widespread.\n\n\nTo achieve our mission, we built a dApp to easily create and operate decentralized organizations on Ethereum. First, we focused on building a feature rich web and desktop (including MacOS, Linux, and Windows) application.\n\n\nBut our initial focus ignored a major way that over 2.3 billion people interact with applications today: their smartphones. The reason we ignored these users was simple\u200a\u2014\u200athe development effort to create mobile applications is significant and would distract from developing fully featured web and desktop versions.\n\n\n\n\nA note for exchanges or holders interacting with ANT in an automated manner\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network Token has vesting built in that limits the transferability of the token until a specified time.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Token Sale Technical Overview\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: ANT is a MiniMe Token with built-in vesting functionality. Two security audits are currently being performed and a bug bounty will begin soon. ANT contract code is live on Github.\n\n\nThis post will discuss the ANT base token and its functionality, the ANT sale contract, and the current state of ANT security and future efforts to ensure a successful token sale.\n\n\n\n\nThe path to mainstream decentralized organizations\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, we published our development plan for Aragon Core and the Aragon Network. This post explains in greater detail our structure to store and allocate funds from Aragon Network Token (ANT) sales, features of the next Aragon Core release, and plans to deploy the Aragon Network and its first organizations.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Development Plan\n\n\nThe road ahead to make decentralized organizations widespread\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we announced our token sale and its terms.\n\n\nToday, we will be addressing the future of Aragon, by releasing our Development Plan.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network Token sale terms\n\n\nFounder vesting, simple pricing and distribution\n\n\n\n\nYesterday we announced the Aragon Network Token sale. Today, we will go into its details. For a simple overview of the sale in just one page, download the one pager.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the Aragon Network Token sale\n\n\nANT sale starts on May 17th. Bootstrapping the creation of the world\u2019s first digital jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\nWe have been asked countless times about whether we would do a token sale or not. Our answer always was: if it makes sense, we will!\n\n\nAfter launching Aragon, we spent a lot of time talking to people and thinking. What will be the main issues to make decentralized organizations widespread?\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Luis, Aragon\u2019s Project Lead\n\n\nLuis talks about why he is creating Aragon and his long-term vision for it\n\n\n\n\nI have interviewed my cofounder Luis\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Project Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the future of the project, and his long term vision.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Network\n\n\nSolving the biggest hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread\n\n\n\n\nOur first step was to develop an extremely easy to use product on top of the Ethereum blockchain that lets everyone run decentralized organizations. Now we have validated the concept, the market interest and most importantly, the main hurdles to realize our vision.\n\n\nThose main hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread are upgradeability and decentralized arbitration.\n\n\n\n\nThe 8 pillars of any organization\n\n\nA walk-through of Aragon and the why behind each feature\n\n\n\n\nWhen we set out to create Aragon, we researched what were the core features that an organization needs.\n\n\nLast year, the 11th of November, we came up with the first version of the product full spec. Most of the features that you see today in Aragon, as well as how they are structured, were laid out that month.\n\n\nSince we have been asked a few times which was our thought process to came up with that features, I\u2019ll go through it.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Jorge, Aragon\u2019s Tech Lead\n\n\nJorge talks about what excites him the most about Aragon, and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nI have interviewed my cofounder Jorge\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Tech Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the Ethereum community, his workspace and the road ahead.\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized organizations can solve the world\u2019s worst problems\n\n\nDisintermediating human trade\u200a\u2014\u200abusiness\u200a\u2014\u200ais the first step towards a more fair world\n\n\n\n\nWe take most power for granted. After all, humans enforce most of their social contracts by giving away some freedom.\n\n\nWe usually think about intermediaries in a microscopic scale. We think about the guy who delivered us a package. Or the agency we hired to find us a buyer for an apartment.\n\n\nYet those intermediaries are insignificant compared to the macro-scale intermediaries.\n\n\n\n\nMarch\n\n\nThe Governance Release, Alpha 0.3 \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\n\n\nBring your token, new bylaws, web version and more\n\n\n\n\nTokens are changing the rules of the game. We don\u2019t need to think about obscure business models anymore. We can align our users\u2019 incentives with ours and release a token that implements that logic.\n\n\nAt Aragon we believe that we are at the dawn of this token model.\n\n\nAnd we want to help the community in this journey.\n\n\nSo today, we are introducing ERC20 token support for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nReleasing Aragon Alpha \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n\nOne month ago, we introduced our vision of how companies and organizations will work. And we set to make it a reality.  \n\n\nToday, I want to personally thank all the community for the warmest welcome we could have ever dreamed of for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Solidity code deployment techniques\n\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation post to the work we did with Zeppelin for the article on Proxy libraries for code upgradeability. Reading that post is not required in order to understand this one, but it is definitely a recommended read, as the ideas are pretty much on the same line. And towards the end we will combine them.\n\n\n\n\nElectron + MetaMask = Secure, Easy to Use Dapps \ud83d\udd12\n\n\nSandboxing Ethereum DApps with Electron\n\n\n\n\nWhen we chose what would be our main build target for Aragon, our priorities for choosing Electron + MetaMask were security and usability.  \n\n\nOf course Aragon also runs on any Web3 environment (like Mist, Parity, Chrome with MetaMask\u2026) but we wanted to have a build target in which we have full control over the user experience.  \n\n\nSince we got part of the community intrigued on how our implementation works, this post hopes to explain our decisions and the challenges we found.\n\n\n\n\nHow Aragon approaches identity and the Ethereum Keybase Resolver\n\n\n\n\nIdentity is one of the most important parts when developing decentralized applications. This is specially true for Aragon, where identity is needed to know who are you doing business with or who are the people that will manage the money you are investing.\n\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\nLibrary Driven Development in Solidity\n\n\n\n\nA comprehensive review on how to develop more modular, reusable and elegant smart contract systems on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine by using libraries\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Aragon: Unstoppable companies\n\n\n\n\nToday, taking a stand to help this fight, we are introducing Aragon.\n\nAragon is everything you need to operate your company or organizational structure, on Ethereum.\n\nAragon lets everyone create value without borders or intermediaries.\n\nCap table, vesting, payments, voting, bylaws, fundraising and identity all in a beautiful, unified interface.",

The Aragon project is currently working on AragonOS, which introduces some major changes to smart contracts as we know them today. More specifically, smart contracts\u2019 underlying architecture is in dire need of some upgrades. Introducing more flexibility and making it easier to extend the functionality of these contracts is well worth looking into.\n\n\n\n\nVenturebeat\n\n\nNo CEO needed: These blockchain platforms will let \u2018the crowd\u2019 run startups\n\n\n\n\nBack in May, I wrote about the concept of DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations capable of running themselves thanks to blockchain technology \u2014 no CEO or C-Suite needed. At the time I was writing, there were a few people in the blockchain community testing out the idea but no strong efforts underway. That was six months ago.\n\n\nAs anyone in the crypto space will tell you, six months is a really long time. Today, a market for DAO platforms is emerging, complete with teams, funding, development, and initial implementations.\n\n\n\n\n12 changes that could shake up the blockchain world in 2018\n\n\n\n\nIf there is one thing I have learned in the last two years in the cryptocurrency world, it\u2019s that things change so quickly in this sector, it can humble anybody. Anyone who says he knows what he is talking about, doesn\u2019t!\n\n\nStill, it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day, so what the heck? I\u2019ll put my neck out there with 12 predictions for 2018:\n\n\n\n\nETHNews\n\n\nAragon ICO Makes Millions In Minutes\n\n\n\n\nIn the time it might take to warm up a small meal, Aragon\u2019s ICO made the company $25 million in Ether.\n\n\nOn May 17, 2017, disintermediation platform Aragon announced it closed an ICO in less than 15 minutes, raking in $25,000,000 in Ether (ETH) from 2,403 investors in exchange for ANT tokens, and making it the fourth highest crowdsale ever.\n\n\n\n\nValueWalk\n\n\nAragon Introduces Grants Program To Further Ecosystem Development\n\n\n\n\nAragon, the governance platform for decentralized organizations, has decided to support its community by introducing \u2018 Aragon Nest \u2019, a unique grants program to accelerate ecosystem development. This is a very exciting initiative and shows the importance of community involvement to the blockchain movement, some experts argue. See more from the company press release below.\n\n\nIntroducing the \u2018Aragon Nest\u2019 Grants Program\n\n\n\n\nHow The Token Model Is Changing Coding For The Better\n\n\n\n\nFor a long time free and open source software was a niche seen by many as a threat to major software developers and large corporations who wished to enforce stricter intellectual property rights. Although patents and intellectual property rights were originally designed to protect the rights of the creators, in coding this is often enforced to the detriment of the community at large.\n\n\nHowever, during the last decades, open source models were gaining popularity and had a loyal following particularly among Linux enthusiasts.\n\n\nOpen source offers great benefits in the areas of cost, flexibility, freedom, security, and accountability. You can see how the code is developed, what it does, and why. Unlike closed proprietary software, code can be altered and extended by any developer.\n\n\n\n\nCCN\n\n\nEthereum-Based Aragon Raises $25 Million Under 15 Minutes in Record ICO\n\n\n\n\nEthereum-based enterprise management platform Aragon has announced details of its Wednesday ICO token sale, raising a mammoth $25 million.\n\n\nThe token sale saw participation from 2,403 buyers around the world and lasted under 15 minutes to raise the figure for a token sale that was originally set to run until June 14, 2017.\n\n\n\n\nEthereum-Based Aragon Partners ShapeShift for Upcoming Token Sale\n\n\n\n\nEthereum-based distributed network platform Aragon has announced a partnership with leading global exchange ShapeShift in advance of their upcoming token sale. Set to launch May 17th, Aragon counts ICONOMI and CoinFund among its pre-sale buyers.\n\n\nThanks to the partnership with ShapeShift, users will be able to purchase Aragon Network Tokens (ANT) using the variety of tokens on the ShapeShift platform such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin.\n\n\n\n\nCointelegraph\n\n\nWhy Aragon Co-Founder Sees Ethereum Price Surpassing $1,000\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Aragon co-founder Luis Cuende revealed that he sees the price of Ethereum, which remains at around $261, hitting $1,000 in the long run.\n\n\nIn an interview with Sindre Hopland, the media producer at Itnig, Cuende explained that the Ethereum market along with the ICO industry is growing at an exponential rate. Both large-scale and small companies are actively investing in the efficiency of Ethereum network in automating operations with the utilization of smart contracts.\n\n\n\n\nBiggest-Ever ICO Jackpot Netted By Ethereum-Based Aragon Despite Bad Actor\n\n\n\n\nEthereum-based business management platform Aragon has raised the largest amount ever in an ICO - almost $25 mln in 15 minutes.\n\n\nThe token sale began at 19:30 GMT on Wednesday, but had already sold out minutes later, with investors contributing a total of 275,000 ETH worth around $24.75 mln.\n\n\n\n\nBankless Times\n\n\nEthereum cofounder Alisie joins Aragon advisory board\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized company management platform Aragon announced this week that original Ethereum cofounder Mihai Alisie has joined its advisory board.\n\n\nMr. Alisie partnered with Vitalik Buterin in 2011 to launch Bitcoin Magazine and later joined him to found Ethereum. He served as strategic manager and vice president of the Ethereum Foundation. The other Aragon advisors are Dai Foundation COO Kenny Rowe and CoinFund cofounder Jake Brukhman.\n\n\n\n\nAudio Interviews\n\n\nDecentralize This! | Ep 12 - Luis Cuende - Realizing The Promise of Decentralized Organizations\n\n\n\n\nHosted by Enigma's Head of Growth Tor Bair, our twelfth episode features Luis Cuende. Luis is the cofounder of Aragon, a platform that allows anyone to create and manage decentralized organizations. He\u2019s an incredible thinker and builder, having published his first book at 18 and having been named to Forbes 30 under 30. Aragon also recently released a new version of their platform on the Ethereum mainnet, which Luis and Tor discuss.\n\n\nOn this episode we\u2019ll also talk why Luis got into the blockchain space, the power of decentralized, autonomous organizations, where our current centralized systems are falling short, and the conflicts between regulation and decentralization - and how those have impacted both Luis and Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nThe Blockchain and Us | Luis Cuende \u2013 How Digital Jurisdictions Help Us Escape 1984 and Take Back Control\n\n\n\n\nLuis Cuende speaks about the inspiration for his startup Aragon, raising over $100 million in his ICO, how he plans to create a digital jurisdiction that isn\u2019t bound to the borders of a single country, how governments manipulate citizens, how he explains the need for digital worlds, which narratives inspire people to reclaim their freedom, societal challenges in the Western world, why jobs are a thing of the past, why he thinks governments should try universal basic income, how blockchains could restrict the power of governments, why he thinks borders create racism, how decentralization on blockchains could create value, the evils of social media, how decentralized systems can avoid the path of social media, why George Orwell\u2019s 1984 is real and what helped this happen, why many people have lost hope, why few digital natives understand the vision of decentralization, and many other things.\n\n\n\n\nSE Daily: How Aragon Manages DAOs with Luis Cuende\n\n\n\n\nAragon is a platform for running and managing decentralized autonomous organizations. Luis Cuende is the founder of Aragon, and joins the show to explain what a DAO is and why people want to create them. We also talk about the engineering of Aragon and the structure of its ICO\u2014which raised $25m via token sale.\n\n\n\n\nAn Ethereum Podcast: Episode #11 | Guest: Luis Cuende and Maria Gomez from Aragon\n\n\n\n\nJoin us to hear more about their new grants program, Aragon Nest as well as how they continue to think about how they are in the process of transforming their DAO-producing organization into a DAO.\n\n\n\n\nThe Boost VC Podcast | Season 2, Ep. 14: Governance, Decentralized Organizations and Valuing Blockchain Technology with Aragon Co-Founder Luis Cuende\n\n\n\n\nListen in as Aragon co-founder Luis Cuende offers his profound insight on the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in Spain, fueled in part by the push for Catalonian independence.\n\n\n\n\nGoverning the Future | E08: Luis Cuende, Aragon - governance, blockchain cap tables, and nation states\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a fully digital, programmable, and transparent organization? What happens when computers can start companies?

Updated Jan. 14th, 2018.\n\n\nAn \nexokernel\n-inspired architecture for modular, upgradeable, and secure DAOs\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis exokernel-inspired architecture enables modular, upgradeable, and secure Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). It implements a UNIX-inspired permissioning system with smart contracts to allow for safe and efficient control over software resources.\n\n\nSmart contracts, an essential component of the Ethereum ecosystem, can define the rules and penalties around an agreement. They can also make decisions and enforce prior commitments, such as transfering large amounts of funds. However, such significant responsibilities make smart contracts a prime target for attacks. Testing and auditing them are not absolute remedies because, inevitably, humans make mistakes.\n\n\nSo, how does one guarantee DAOs that run efficiently and securely? And how do we provide upgrading capabilities to these DAOs, to ensure the safety and evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\n\nWe present our secure decentralized operating system: \naragonOS\n.\n\n\nThis document provides a technical overview about the architecture. For a less technically-oriented introduction to aragonOS, you can check the \nannouncement blog post\n.\n\n\n1. Kernel and the Access Control List\n\n\nThe \nAccess Control List\n (ACL) is the filter which determines whether an \nentity\n has a certain role in the context of an app. It either permits or prohibits performing actions, such as an update, in a given context, as well as determining the entities with power over that permission.\n\n\nThe ACL permissioning system is inspired by UNIX. ACLs control the permissions afforded to a user in the system and can ease the transfer of said permissions. Similar to the \nsudo\n command in UNIX, users can escalate permissions, but with more flexibility and granularity.\n\n\nA reference implementation of the Kernel and its ACL can be found here: \nKernel.sol\n.\n\n\nApps and Actions\n\n\nApp\ns are smart contracts that rely on the Kernel\u2014the core of the operating system\u2014for maintaining their ACL and upgrading their code. Apps can interact with users and other smart contracts by implementing \nAction\ns, where each action is a publicly-accessible function that may or may not be protected by the ACL. Any actions that are protected are only allowed to be executed if the caller is permitted by the ACL. Because apps are upgradeable, we expect them to exist for a long period of time and be safely responsible for owning assets on behalf of the DAO (e.g. tokens and ENS names).\n\n\nApp instances are identified by their deployed Ethereum addresses. More than one instance of a particular app can be installed in a DAO at a time (e.g. multiple \nToken Manager\n instances can be installed to control multiple tokens).\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nAnother feature in ensuring security within the ecosystem is the ease of delegating responsibilities for autonomous execution. Apps can define any number of \nRole\ns, where each role grants access to one or more of the app's actions as part of the app's ACL. Any entity wishing to perform an action protected by the ACL must have the necessary permissions by having a role that is capable of executing that action.\n\n\nRoles are always unique to each app. Having a given role in one app does not grant the permission to perform that same role in other apps.\n\n\nAn entity can have many roles in one app.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ncontract TokenApp is App {\n    bytes32 constant public MINT_ROLE = 0x1234;\n    function mint(address _receiver, uint256 _amount) auth(MINT_ROLE) { \u2026 }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTokenApp\n is an app that defines one action, \nmint()\n, whose execution is controlled by \nMINT_ROLE\n.\n\n\nEntity\n\n\nAn \nEntity\n is any actor that is represented by an Ethereum address, such as a multisig (an account that needs multiple signatures before executing an action), an app (for example, a voting app that only executes an action if token holders vote favorably), or a simple private key controlled account.\n\n\nThe system can delegate permissions to groups of entities by implementing a Group app. As in other apps, it can rely on the ACL for protecting important functions, such as adding or removing members of the group. When group members want to execute a specific action, the Group app acts as a proxy contract that performs the action on behalf of the group.\n\n\nPermissions\n\n\nA \nPermission\n is defined as the ability to perform actions (grouped by roles) in a certain app instance (identified by its address).\n\n\nWe refer to a \nPermission Instance\n as an entity holding a certain permission.\n\n\nWhen a permission is created, a \nPermission Manager\n is set for that specific permission. The permission manager is able to grant or revoke permission instances for that permission.\n\n\nCreate Permission\n\n\nkernel.createPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role, address manager)\n\n\n\n\ncreatePermission()\n will fail if that permission has pre-existing permission instances.\n\n\nThis action is identical to \ngrantPermission()\n except it allows the creation of a new permission if it doesn\u2019t exist yet.\n\n\nA role in the ACL protects access to \ncreatePermission()\n as this important function could be used in malicious ways. When the Kernel is initialized, it also creates the permission that grants the initializing address the ability to create new permissions.\n\n\nNote that creating permissions is made mandatory by the ACL: all actions requiring yet-to-be-created permissions are disallowed by default. Any permission checks on non-existent permissions are failed automatically.\n\n\nGrant Permission\n\n\nkernel.grantPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\nGrants \nrole\n in \napp\n for an \nentity\n. Only callable by the \nmanager\n of a certain permission. This \nentity\n would then be allowed to call all actions that their \nrole\n can perform on that particular \napp\n until the permission manager revokes their role with \nrevokePermission()\n.\n\n\nThe \ngrantPermission()\n action doesn\u2019t require protection with the ACL because an entity can only make changes to a permission if it is the permission's \nmanager\n.\n\n\nRevoke Permission\n\n\nkernel.revokePermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\nRevokes \nrole\n in \napp\n for an \nentity\n. Only callable by the \nmanager\n of a certain permission.\n\n\nThe \nrevokePermission()\n action doesn\u2019t need to be protected by the ACL either, as an entity can only make changes if it is the \nmanager\n for a given permission.\n\n\nSet Permission Manager\n\n\nkernel.setPermissionManager(address newManager, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\nChanges the permission manager to \nnewManager\n. Only callable by the \nmanager\n of a certain permission.\n\n\nThe new permission manager replaces the old permission manager, resulting in the old manager losing any management power over that permission.\n\n\ncreatePermission()\n executes a special case of this action to set the initial manager for the newly created permission. From that point forward, the manager can only be changed with \nsetPermissionManager()\n.\n\n\nEvents\n\n\ncreatePermission()\n, \ngrantPermission()\n, and \nrevokePermission()\n all fire the same \nSetPermission\n event that Aragon clients are expected to cache and process into a locally stored version of the ACL:\n\n\nSetPermission(address indexed from, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed to, bool allowed)\n\n\n\n\nsetPermissionManager()\n fires the following event:\n\n\nChangePermissionManager(address indexed app, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed manager)\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAs an example, the following steps show a complete flow for user \"Root\" to create a new DAO with the basic permissions set so that a \nVoting app\n can manage the funds stored in a \nVault app\n:\n\n\n\n\nDeploy the Kernel\n\n\nExecuting \nkernel.initialize(rootAddress)\n creates the \"permissions creator\" permission under the hood:\n\ncreatePermission(rootAddress, kernelAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, rootAddress)\n\n\nDeploy the Voting app\n\n\nGrant the Voting app the ability to call \ncreatePermission()\n:\n\ngrantPermission(votingAppAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, kernelAddress)\n (must be executed by \nrootAddress\n)\n\n\nDeploy the Vault app, which has a action called \ntransferTokens()\n\n\nCreate a new vote via the Voting app to create the \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n permission\n\ncreatePermission(votingAppAddress, vaultAppAddress, TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE, votingAppAddress)\n\n\nIf the vote passes, the Voting app then has access to all actions in the Vault protected by \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n, which in this case is just \ntransferTokens()\n\n\nFund transfers from the Vault can now be controlled via votes from the Voting app. Each time a user wishes to transfer funds, they can create a new vote via the Voting app to propose an execution of the Vault's \ntransferTokens()\n action. If, and only if, the vote passes, will the \ntransferTokens()\n action be executed.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the Voting app is also able to revoke or regrant the \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n permission as it is that permission's manager on \nvaultAppAddress\n.\n\n\nAdding Permissions\n\n\nApps have the choice of which actions to protect behind the ACL, as some actions may make sense to be completely public. Protecting an action behind the ACL is done in the smart contract by simply adding the authentication modifier \nauth()\n (passing the role required as a parameter) to the action. On executing the action, the \nauth()\n modifier checks with the Kernel whether the entity performing the call holds the required role or not.\n\n\nEscalating Permissions\n\n\nConsider kernel \nK\n, an entity \nE\n0\n, and an app \nA\n. \nE\n0\n wants to perform action \nA\nact\n on app \nA\n. The client knows, from \ninformation provided as part of the app's metadata\n, that in order to perform \nA\nact\n, an entity is required to have \nA\nrole\n. Since \nE\n0\n doesn't hold \nA\nrole\n, the client should know that \nE\n0\n cannot directly call \nA\nact\n, but that a list of entities [\nE\n1\n, \nE\n2\n, ...] do have that role on app \nA\n. The client should then show the user the multiple possible forwarding paths to pass the call to \nE\n1\n, \nE\n2\n, etc, such that \nE\n0\n is able to perform \nA\nact\n through another, higher-privileged, entity.\n\n\nCalculating a forwarding path requires knowing what \nforwarders\n entity \nE\n0\n can escalate actions through. The user or contract performing this action could then choose their preferred route to forward permissions in order to perform \nA\nact\n. For example, \nE\n1\n may be a Voting app \nV\n, so the action would be to create a new vote that, in case of being approved, would call \nA\nact\n. Since \nV\n has role \nA\nrole\n, it has permission to execute \nA\nact\n, and therefore we would have successfully completed a permission escalation.\n\n\nPermission escalations can be multiple levels deep. For example, imagine a user wants to invoke an action that requires a vote. If the only entity with permission to create a vote is the \nToken Manager app\n, then the user will have to forward their action first through the Token Manager and then through the Voting app. The Token Manager only allows a sender to forward actions if the sender owns tokens, so in this case, the user will also need to hold tokens before being able to start a vote.\n\n\nNote that a permission escalation can occur instantly or be delayed and require further action from other entities, like in the case of the Voting app.\n\n\n\n\nForwarders\n\n\nIn order to make permission escalation easier, we define a common interface for \nForwarder\ns:\n\n\ncontract Forwarder {\n   bool isForwarder = true;\n   function canForward(address sender, bytes evmCallScript) view returns (bool);\n   function forward(bytes evmCallScript);\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf a user wants to enact an action it cannot perform directly, it can check if there are forwarders. This checks for privileged entities that are accessible to any of the user's addresses for forwarding the action to.\n\n\nEVM Call Script\n\n\nThe \nevmCallScript\n parameter in the \nForwarder's\n interface allows for executing multiple calls with just one transaction. This is useful, for example, in the case of votings, as it allows approving multiple actions with just one vote.\n\n\nAn \nevmCallScript\n is the concatenation of multiple \nevmCallAction\ns. A \nevmCallAction\n payload is:\n\n\n[ to (address: 20 bytes) ] [ calldataLength (uint32: 4 bytes)  ] [ calldata (calldataLength bytes) ]\n\n\nWhen executed, actions in the \nevmCallScript\n are executed one at a time using the \nCALL\n opcode. If any one of the actions fails (i.e. \nCALL\n returns 0), the entire execution is reverted.\n\n\nA reference implementation for EVM Call Script can be found here: \nEVMCallScript.sol\n.\n\n\n2. Upgradeability\n\n\nUpgradeability of the system is achieved by using the \nDelegateProxy\n pattern. Kernel and apps (\nKernelProxy\n and \nAppProxy\n) both use \nDelegateProxy\n with some added functionality.\n\n\n\n\nGiven that new versions of apps or the kernel run in the exact same context as previous versions, the old storage layout must be taken into account. Inheriting from the old contract's storage before adding new storage variables is considered a safe practice. It is recommended to make sure the upgrade doesn't break the storage before pushing a new version. We will work on tooling to prevent issues with storage when upgrading.\n\n\n2.1. Kernel upgradeability\n\n\nFor the \nKernel\n to be easily upgradeable, cheaply deployable, and more efficient, we use a proxy-type construct. Deploying a new DAO is done by deploying a \nKernelProxy\n contract that just delegates all calls to a kernel implementation at a given address, while still maintaining its own storage. Upgrading the kernel implementation in the proxy is as easy as changing its reference to another implementation's address.\n\n\nNote that, although this action is fairly easy to complete, it is extremely critical to the DAO and should be protected accordingly.\n\n\n2.2. App-space upgradeability\n\n\nAs apps can be used as entities (e.g. a voting app), it is important that each app is able to keep its address fixed to maintain its identity even if an upgrade changes the underlying logic. Keeping a fixed address also simplifies the upgrade process\u2014otherwise, each upgrade would also require any associated permissions in the ACL to be updated to the app's new address.\n\n\nOne way of achieving this is through the concept of an \nAppProxy\n contract (inspired by \naugur-core\u2019s \nDelegators\n). Deploying an app via an \nAppProxy\n contract only requires a reference to the Kernel and the app identifier. When the app receives a call, it gets intercepted by the proxy's fallback function. At this point, the proxy asks the Kernel for the latest address of the app code for a given app identifier and version. The AppProxy contract then forwards the call by \ndelegatecall\ning into this address.\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that multiple \nAppProxy\n contracts can be installed in a DAO for the same app identifier (e.g. multiple \nFundraising\n \nAppProxy\n instances can be attached to the same Kernel to control multiple types of funding). As the Kernel keeps a centralized record of the latest version of the code for each app identifier, changing one reference in the Kernel effectively updates all instances of that app in that organization. These upgrades could then be delegated to another contract, e.g. the Aragon Network, in case organizations don\u2019t want to handle manual upgrades of their own apps.\n\n\nSet App Code\n\n\nkernel.setAppCode(bytes32 appId, address appCode)\n\n\n\n\nThis action updates the implementation code registered for a given \nappId\n, such that all future calls to the app will use the new app code. If multiple app instances are installed for the given \nappId\n, they are all updated at the same time with this action.\n\n\nNote that all calls to an app will fail if an \nappId\n has not been set for its \nappCode\n.\n\n\n3. Initialization\n\n\nThe contracts that get deployed for each Kernel and app don't contain any business logic due to them relying on a proxy-like architecture for upgradeability. The proxy contracts are merely a way to point to the logic when called.\n\n\nHowever, this architecture impedes the ability to call the Solidity constructor. Constructors are run only on contract creation but not stored as part of the account code.\n\n\nWe instead use a 'regular function' to perform initialization on each proxy. This function can only be called after the \nAppProxy\n contract has been deployed. To impede attacks in which a malicious actor tries to front-run an initialization transaction between the deployment and the legit initialization transaction, \nAppProxy\n allows you to pass an initialization payload that will only be executed on deployment, allowing for atomic initializations of apps.\n\n\nIt is important that this initialization function can only be called once per proxy. Instead of just saving a boolean when a component has been initialized, we store the block number when the initialization occurred. Clients can then use this to know from which block they should filter for events.\n\n\n4. App discoverability and package versioning\n\n\nTechnically, an app \nA\n is nothing more than a simple \nAppProxy\n contract holding a reference to a kernel \nK\n and an \nappId\n. If \nA\n doesn\u2019t have any permissions, both incoming and outgoing, set in \nK\n, \nA\n is effectively irrelevant to the DAO as nothing can call it and it cannot call anything. So the notion of installing an app is replaced with the notion of creating permissions for an app (i.e. defining what entities can do with the app and what the app can do in other apps).\n\n\nAll relevant apps in a DAO should be discoverable by traversing its ACL, checking if any addresses are \nAppProxy\ns, and checking if those \nAppProxy\ns have a reference to the DAO\u2019s kernel. If that is the case, then the apps matching those \nAppProxy\ns' \nappId\ns are considered installed in the DAO.\n\n\nApplication identifiers (\nappId\ns) should be the \nnamehash\ned\n ENS name for the app's deployed contract:\n\n\nappId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d)\n\n\n\n\nAn app's \nappId\n can be used as the identifier for its full package (including the app's frontend and other artifacts).\n\n\nAragon owns and provides \naragonpm.eth\n as a domain for developers to register their packages under. However, the system is designed to be domain agnostic: for example, district0x could decide to have all their packages under \npackages.district.eth\n.\n\n\nApp Repos\n\n\nAfter discovering an entity in the DAO that is an app, we can fetch its \nappId\n and use ENS to resolve its Repo contract:\n\n\nrepo = Resolver(ens.resolver(appId)).addr(appId)\n\n\n\n\nRepo contracts conform to the original Aragon Versioning Protocol but add more on-chain checks for version upgrades.\n\n\nEach Repo has an owner which is an Ethereum address that can create new versions of the package. This ownership right can be transferred to another address by the owner.\n\n\nA Repo keeps versioned state over:\n\n\n\n\nSmart contract app code (\ncontractAddress\n): the app code is the address of the deployed version of the app. The Kernel determines which version of the app it uses by pointing to the app code address associated with that version.\n\n\nPackage content (\ncontentURI\n): defined by a location ID of where the other components of the package (e.g. frontend) are hosted (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) and the content hash for fetching it.\n\n\n\n\nBy versioning both the app code address and the package content, we can build in additional expectations for the semantic versioning of apps:\n\n\n\n\nPatch\n: Minor changes to the package contents (e.g. frontend). Update can be performed silently for users.\n\n\nMinor\n: Major changes to the package contents, but still works with the current smart contract code. Users should be notified of the update.\n\n\nMajor\n: Any change to the smart contract app code with or without an accompanying frontend upgrade. User interaction is needed to upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nA correct version upgrade for a package is defined by the following rules:\n\n\n\n\nOnly one member of the version is increased by 1. The version components to the left of the raised member must stay the same and the components to the right must be 0.\n\n\nExample: From 2.1.3 the only allowed raises are to 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version), and 2.1.4 (patch version).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges to the app code address can only be done if the raise changes the major version (upgrading it to x.0.0 by the above rule).\n\n\n\n\nBy having this check performed at the smart contract level, we can load the correct version of the frontend just by looking at an instance of an app. This is done by checking that the version of a smart contract is linked to a given app by getting its \nappId\n and \nappCode\n.\n\n\nAdditional Packaging Requirements\n\n\nThe package that is stored off-chain must contain a standard \nmanifest.json\n.\n\n\nWe also introduce a specific \neth.json\n file with the following keys, to help connect an app's frontend to its smart contracts:\n\n\n\n\nabi\n: Standard \nEthereum Contract ABI\n\n\nbytecode\n: Initialization code for deploying the app code to the network.\n\n\nfunctions\n: An array of all the relevant function signatures for the contract, with its \nnatspec\n description, argument names, and whether the function is protected by the ACL or not (and which role is required, if protected). These can be automatically generated on package publish.\n\n\npermissions\n: An array of permissions the app needs to have over other entities in order to work. This will probably be dependent on initialization parameters. For example: a Finance app will need permissions over the Vault it is initialized with.\n\n\nverification\n: An object providing the needed information to independently verify the source code of the deployed code. Required values include: \ndeployTxId\n, \nsourceCode\n, and the compiler settings, solc version, and optimization settings.\n\n\n\n\nAn initial implementation of the contracts supporting package management can be found in the \napm-contracts repo\n.",

Upgrading the kernel implementation in the proxy is as easy as changing its reference to another implementation's address.

Keeping a fixed address also simplifies the upgrade process\u2014otherwise, each upgrade would also require any associated permissions in the ACL to be updated to the app's new address.  One way of achieving this is through the concept of an  AppProxy  contract (inspired by  augur-core\u2019s  Delegators ). Deploying an app via an  AppProxy  contract only requires a reference to the Kernel and the app identifier. When the app receives a call, it gets intercepted by the proxy's fallback function. At this point, the proxy asks the Kernel for the latest address of the app code for a given app identifier and version. The AppProxy contract then forwards the call by  delegatecall ing into this address.   It should be noted that multiple  AppProxy  contracts can be installed in a DAO for the same app identifier (e.g. multiple  Fundraising   AppProxy  instances can be attached to the same Kernel to control multiple types of funding). As the Kernel keeps a centralized record of the latest version of the code for each app identifier, changing one reference in the Kernel effectively updates all instances of that app in that organization. These upgrades could then be delegated to another contract, e.g. the Aragon Network, in case organizations don\u2019t want to handle manual upgrades of their own apps.",

Constructors are run only on contract creation but not stored as part of the account code.  We instead use a 'regular function' to perform initialization on each proxy. This function can only be called after the  AppProxy  contract has been deployed. To impede attacks in which a malicious actor tries to front-run an initialization transaction between the deployment and the legit initialization transaction,  AppProxy  allows you to pass an initialization payload that will only be executed on deployment, allowing for atomic initializations of apps.  It is important that this initialization function can only be called once per proxy. Instead of just saving a boolean when a component has been initialized, we store the block number when the initialization occurred.

So the notion of installing an app is replaced with the notion of creating permissions for an app (i.e. defining what entities can do with the app and what the app can do in other apps).  All relevant apps in a DAO should be discoverable by traversing its ACL, checking if any addresses are  AppProxy s, and checking if those  AppProxy s have a reference to the DAO\u2019s kernel. If that is the case, then the apps matching those  AppProxy s'  appId s are considered installed in the DAO.  Application identifiers ( appId s) should be the  namehash ed  ENS name for the app's deployed contract:  appId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d)  An app's  appId  can be used as the identifier for its full package (including the app's frontend and other artifacts).

Each Repo has an owner which is an Ethereum address that can create new versions of the package. This ownership right can be transferred to another address by the owner.  A Repo keeps versioned state over:   Smart contract app code ( contractAddress ): the app code is the address of the deployed version of the app. The Kernel determines which version of the app it uses by pointing to the app code address associated with that version.  Package content ( contentURI ): defined by a location ID of where the other components of the package (e.g. frontend) are hosted (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) and the content hash for fetching it.   By versioning both the app code address and the package content, we can build in additional expectations for the semantic versioning of apps:   Patch : Minor changes to the package contents (e.g. frontend). Update can be performed silently for users.  Minor : Major changes to the package contents, but still works with the current smart contract code. Users should be notified of the update.  Major : Any change to the smart contract app code with or without an accompanying frontend upgrade. User interaction is needed to upgrade.   A correct version upgrade for a package is defined by the following rules:   Only one member of the version is increased by 1. The version components to the left of the raised member must stay the same and the components to the right must be 0.  Example: From 2.1.3 the only allowed raises are to 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version), and 2.1.4 (patch version).    Changes to the app code address can only be done if the raise changes the major version (upgrading it to x.0.0 by the above rule).   By having this check performed at the smart contract level, we can load the correct version of the frontend just by looking at an instance of an app. This is done by checking that the version of a smart contract is linked to a given app by getting its  appId  and  appCode .",

They met via Twitter when they were only 15 years old, and immediately started building products together.\n\n\nAt the age of 17, they prototyped a fully decentralized Internet replacement by using mesh networks, blockchain technology and protocols like Bluetooth LE and WiFi Direct.\n\n\nStampery\n\u2014Luis\u2019 latest company\u2014made blockchain timestamping accessible, and has worked with institutions like the Estonian government, Microsoft and Telefonica. It participated in TechCrunch Disrupt and was backed by billionaire Tim Draper.\n\n\nLuis has also been recognized as a \n30 Under 30 by Forbes\n and \nInnovator Under 35 by the MIT\n.\n\n\nBefore building Aragon, Luis and Jorge were in Silicon Valley working on solving the problem of patent trolls with Unpatent. After figuring out how broken the underlying infrastructure of innovation is\u2014patent trolls thriving, Donald Trump winning the elections, bureaucracy eating entrepreneurship\u2014they decided to focus all of their time in building the infrastructure that new companies and organizations will run on top of.\u2029\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen talking about Aragon, taking a step back and thinking about the why of organizational structures like companies is a sane move.\nFirms or companies exist in order to create value by using resources to create products or provide services.\nHowever, intermediaries and third parties such as governments decrease the output of those organizations by imposing restrictions and creating complex regulatory frameworks.\nAragon was born to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies and other organizational structures.\n\n\nLuis and Jorge were very inspired by Nobel prize Ronald Coase and his amazing paper \nThe Nature of the Firm\n and Yochai Benkler's \nLinux and the Nature of the Firm\n. Both explore the concept of companies.\n\n\nAt Aragon, we believe that the blockchain and the Internet are changing the incentives for companies to exist, and we are building tools for the next generation of companies that will take advantage of these changes.\n\n\nHowever, for decentralized organizations to be widespread, we need to make sure that they are easy to use, upgradeable/durable and able to resolve human disputes.\n\n\nWe want to solve\u2014either us or partnering with others\u2014those points in order to make decentralized organizations widespread.\n\n\nAnd, thanks to the Aragon dapp and the Aragon Network, we can solve those points.\n\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAragon Community\n, defining the community members contributing to the dapp and Network and the Aragon Network Token holders.\n\n\nAragon Association\n, from now on, \nthe Association\n, a non-profit organization based in Switzerland, will serve as the umbrella organization responsible for allocating resources to other bodies for future cryptocurrency research and development going forward.

At the age of 17, they prototyped a fully decentralized Internet replacement by using mesh networks, blockchain technology and protocols like Bluetooth LE and WiFi Direct.  Stampery \u2014Luis\u2019 latest company\u2014made blockchain timestamping accessible, and has worked with institutions like the Estonian government, Microsoft and Telefonica. It participated in TechCrunch Disrupt and was backed by billionaire Tim Draper.  Luis has also been recognized as a  30 Under 30 by Forbes  and  Innovator Under 35 by the MIT .  Before building Aragon, Luis and Jorge were in Silicon Valley working on solving the problem of patent trolls with Unpatent. After figuring out how broken the underlying infrastructure of innovation is\u2014patent trolls thriving, Donald Trump winning the elections, bureaucracy eating entrepreneurship\u2014they decided to focus all of their time in building the infrastructure that new companies and organizations will run on top of.\u2029     When talking about Aragon, taking a step back and thinking about the why of organizational structures like companies is a sane move.\nFirms or companies exist in order to create value by using resources to create products or provide services.\nHowever, intermediaries and third parties such as governments decrease the output of those organizations by imposing restrictions and creating complex regulatory frameworks.\nAragon was born to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies and other organizational structures.  Luis and Jorge were very inspired by Nobel prize Ronald Coase and his amazing paper  The Nature of the Firm  and Yochai Benkler's  Linux and the Nature of the Firm . Both explore the concept of companies.  At Aragon, we believe that the blockchain and the Internet are changing the incentives for companies to exist, and we are building tools for the next generation of companies that will take advantage of these changes.  However, for decentralized organizations to be widespread, we need to make sure that they are easy to use, upgradeable/durable and able to resolve human disputes.  We want to solve\u2014either us or partnering with others\u2014those points in order to make decentralized organizations widespread.  And, thanks to the Aragon dapp and the Aragon Network, we can solve those points.",
